in carp circles
your smile
<|endoftext|>

Cup of tea
It is finally empty
smoke of incense
<|endoftext|>

mist on the fields
just is glimpsed
the loose crumbling
<|endoftext|>

it breaks the silence
the negra lullaby
there over the pier
<|endoftext|>

on the last step
you turned

Silence and then
<|endoftext|>

King in armor
a mantle of snow
on his shoulders
<|endoftext|>

Ghetto in the morning
lined up, cold,
against the wall
<|endoftext|>

in the twilight

<|endoftext|>

like every night
the voices in the street
lilac flower
<|endoftext|>

Moon Reveals blackberries
Each night of herself
