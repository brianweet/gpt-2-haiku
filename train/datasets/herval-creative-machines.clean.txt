twines across the sky
the northbound train departs
<|endoftext|>

dawn chorus begins
I reach for
the snooze button
<|endoftext|>

en haut des cuisses
dans l'espace sous le slip
un morceau de mer
<|endoftext|>

new March snow
the grouse with a missing toe
still around
<|endoftext|>

Remembrance Day-
even the traffic
pauses for 2 minutes
<|endoftext|>

21-gun salute-
mortar fire echoes
in his eyes
<|endoftext|>

dignified march-
veterans and peacekeepers
pass the applause
<|endoftext|>

morning commute-
headlights fade
in the whiteout
<|endoftext|>

homebound ferry
thoughts zigzagging
with the terns
<|endoftext|>

yellow walnut leaves
slowly appear on the lawn
early morning light
<|endoftext|>

the mulberry
one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work
<|endoftext|>

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze 
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

summer clouds 
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti
<|endoftext|>

rabbit and the hawk -
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red
<|endoftext|>

quick mid-winter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace
<|endoftext|>

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog
<|endoftext|>

shoots of green grain-
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway
<|endoftext|>

dirtballs, dust and clay
a drilling rig's relentless motion
<|endoftext|>

through autumn's dusk
the computer wanes and hums
one hundred crows
<|endoftext|>

autumn deepens
we gather the few
remaining seeds
<|endoftext|>

an aroma
of green walnuts
summer dusk
<|endoftext|>

100 degree heat
country-western music
from the asian bar
<|endoftext|>

reaching
for a new found warmth
sweet rhubarb cake 
<|endoftext|>

she's found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring
<|endoftext|>

distant voices
a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow
<|endoftext|>

solo trip
in the campfire smoke
old memories
<|endoftext|>

long ago
I threw your letters away
footprints in snow
<|endoftext|>

afraid of a boy
with an old man's eyes
needles of frost
<|endoftext|>

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold half-moon
<|endoftext|>

dull in a crescent's light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood
<|endoftext|>

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon
<|endoftext|>

sunflower
the day passing
slowly
<|endoftext|>

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day
<|endoftext|>

moon phase
the welfare check
comes on the fifth
<|endoftext|>

rose petals
fallen on bare earth
evening rain
<|endoftext|>

raindrops
my sister's voice
from half a continent
away
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
the bluebird's call
clearly audible
<|endoftext|>

the wasp
trapped between panes of glass
first spring light
<|endoftext|>

a hazy moon
floats in my cup
white sake
<|endoftext|>

temperature rising
thunderstorms and traffic noise
through the north window
<|endoftext|>

homeless
pushing a cart along
Commerce Avenue
<|endoftext|>

a line of coal cars 
viewed from the railroad bridge 
returning chill
<|endoftext|>

icicles melting
another drunk pisses
in my alley
<|endoftext|>

taking a bite
from a bitter orange
january thaw
<|endoftext|>

last to close
<|endoftext|>

a homeless man
comforts his dog
<|endoftext|>

city sunrise
these old buildings
cast long shadows
<|endoftext|>

night shift
in the parking lot car lights
dim near morning
<|endoftext|>

what day is this?
the metronome gathers dust
in the corner
<|endoftext|>

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker 
<|endoftext|>

no work today
a carpenter ant wanders
aimlessly
<|endoftext|>

garage sale
customers discuss
philosophy 
<|endoftext|>

garage sale
'tales of power'
for half price
<|endoftext|>

taiko drummers
listening to silence
between the beats
<|endoftext|>

no moon, no stars,
just dull light from the city
summer haze
<|endoftext|>

lost
on wildwood road
water lilies directionless
<|endoftext|>

suddenly
the toads go quiet
rain begins
<|endoftext|>

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea
<|endoftext|>

rabbit trail
nothing but ears
above the snow
<|endoftext|>

firecrackers
far off in the distance
pepper on my tongue
<|endoftext|>

between the drone
of lawnmowers
a scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

returning chill
dissonate melodies
from the ice cream truck
<|endoftext|>

waiting for the moon
before departing
ducks on the roof
<|endoftext|>

person-to crown me
even for one night
<|endoftext|>

Gold medal
on the back of the jewel
my sweat
<|endoftext|>

so bright and round
the station clock
<|endoftext|>

sudden downpour -
crying and then laughter teen
Employment quest
<|endoftext|>

muddy grave -
the rich scent of roses
so red
<|endoftext|>

full moon -
the bride tells me
it was forced
<|endoftext|>

lingering cold...
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf
<|endoftext|>

fridge magnet -
snack after snack
wasting away
<|endoftext|>

advanced Parkinsonism
she wipes his dribbling saliva
remembers his kisses
<|endoftext|>

half-moon
first day of the sales
in Oxford Street
<|endoftext|>

in a silver tin - departing guests
linger a while

to show his age
<|endoftext|>

my best haiku ever
...... digested

to and fro... an ant
<|endoftext|>

long barge
slow on the canal
the moon
<|endoftext|>

almost lost
among the shifting hues
of dusk
the faint calligraphy
of swans
<|endoftext|>

crocus breeze -
my dying mother's words
come back to me 
<|endoftext|>

august wind
on the dock seagulls
stand on two legs
<|endoftext|>

sudden downpour -
the memory of a butterfly
washed away
<|endoftext|>

the corridor
was long and dark...
news of your death
closer
with each step
<|endoftext|>

from one year
to another -
the same moon
<|endoftext|>

day moon -
the distance between us
full of silence
<|endoftext|>

A rippled moon :
In the pond, 
A sinking stone.
<|endoftext|>

Lighting the room,
candle by candle
a winter evening.
<|endoftext|>

my umbrella
flipped in the wind–
uncertain days
<|endoftext|>

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog
<|endoftext|>

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown
<|endoftext|>

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky
<|endoftext|>

georgia peach
sweet cream and wrinkle remover
in the shopping cart
<|endoftext|>

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side
<|endoftext|>

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight
<|endoftext|>

clothes dried on the line-
a spring morning
still in the folds
<|endoftext|>

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth
<|endoftext|>

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries
<|endoftext|>

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand
<|endoftext|>

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows
<|endoftext|>

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring
<|endoftext|>

haiku group
the discussion stops
for a robin
<|endoftext|>

bus stop-
the winter dance
of cold feet
<|endoftext|>

buttocks after another
it precedes me
Gare Saint-Lazare
<|endoftext|>

sea breeze 
under full sail
a pregnant skipper
<|endoftext|>

fresh snow
beginning the new year
with a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room
<|endoftext|>

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels
<|endoftext|>

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze
<|endoftext|>

cold sunshine
the stray orange cat
tucked into itself
<|endoftext|>

sleety rain
flowered umbrellas
sold out
<|endoftext|>

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page
<|endoftext|>

drifting
from somewhere
pear blossoms
<|endoftext|>

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring
<|endoftext|>

road closed
moose tracks continue on
local traffic only
<|endoftext|>

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow
<|endoftext|>

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes
<|endoftext|>

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses
<|endoftext|>

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn
<|endoftext|>

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath
<|endoftext|>

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire
<|endoftext|>

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age
<|endoftext|>

bouquets of lilacs
the last bunch fills
a milk bottle
<|endoftext|>

twilight rain
the scent of lilacs
through the window
<|endoftext|>

dead heading lilacs
the fragrance lingers
in memory
<|endoftext|>

strong winter wind
bits of Batman kite wings
fall from the tree
<|endoftext|>

April warmth-
a new crop of dandelions
since yesterday
<|endoftext|>

an ant in my bed-
for the two of us
not enough room
<|endoftext|>

Hurricane Irene
in the semi-darkness
a cold breakfast
<|endoftext|>

heavy time
slowly ticking the minutes
Hurricane Irene
<|endoftext|>

Fourth of July
watching fireflies
on the lawn
<|endoftext|>

between morning chores
I open the door-
lilacs in the rain
<|endoftext|>

the neighbor's lilacs-
gathering the fragrance
to myself
<|endoftext|>

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice
<|endoftext|>

blank date book-
the gray afternoon
turns to white
<|endoftext|>

sleet and rain-
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush
<|endoftext|>

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain
<|endoftext|>

early autumn
the sound of falling water
is cold
<|endoftext|>

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time-
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

cricket in the house-
if only we shared
the same bedtime
<|endoftext|>

the Thanksgiving meal -
after eating the talk
slows down
<|endoftext|>

black-out
the holiday glow
of fireflies
<|endoftext|>

black-out
in my neighbor's house
a room to room glow
<|endoftext|>

in the back alley
school-kids puffing away
in the shadow of a chimney
<|endoftext|>

riverside promenade 
seniors stroll through
falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

a koi rises
to meet a falling leaf -
autumn afternoon
<|endoftext|>

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections
<|endoftext|>

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field...
journey's end.
<|endoftext|>

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh
february rains
<|endoftext|>

high tide
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves
<|endoftext|>

january freeze
koi chase each other
above the television
<|endoftext|>

groundhog day...
sharing a sausage
with friends
<|endoftext|>

autumn seabreeze...
a film of salt forms
on his glasses
<|endoftext|>

grey morning...
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog
<|endoftext|>

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree...
white snow cover
<|endoftext|>

new widescreen tv:
watching junk in
high definition
<|endoftext|>

winter day's end... 
a bowl of brown rice miso, 
warm in the hands
<|endoftext|>

homework 
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds
<|endoftext|>

december warm spell
the neighborhood snowmen
are all plastic
<|endoftext|>

frosty meadow 
another dawn
reaches across
<|endoftext|>

between sips... 
reading a book 
about sake
<|endoftext|>

her piano-playing 
comes to an end... 
sounds of autumn hail
<|endoftext|>

first snowfall
the dog's legs
have become shorter
<|endoftext|>

first snowfall...
here is a christmas card
to be mailed, last year
<|endoftext|>

at a desk,
i write
this ku
<|endoftext|>

a bluejay takes flight
the neighbour's car
needs washing
<|endoftext|>

grey sky
a monarch butterfly
lost in autumn
<|endoftext|>

after the guests leave
the lilies
open
<|endoftext|>

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road
<|endoftext|>

old pond
after the frog
the stillness
<|endoftext|>

frost
on the spent firework casing
new year's day
<|endoftext|>

winter park -
white wings and blue lights
flashing
<|endoftext|>

frozen in time
<|endoftext|>

a wasp
struggling in the web
last apples
<|endoftext|>

clematis climbing
climbing through
the climbing rose
<|endoftext|>

fifteen elephants -
after the storm
the cockerels waking 
<|endoftext|>

kicks a can around
<|endoftext|>

day long weeding
the last dandelion
under my bench 
<|endoftext|>

lazy rain
the solitary blackbird's
dawn chorus
<|endoftext|>

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish
<|endoftext|>

last light
on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp
<|endoftext|>

crushed shell
in the morning light
the snail's last movements
<|endoftext|>

elevator
an ex's scent
hanging
<|endoftext|>

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat
<|endoftext|>

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest
<|endoftext|>

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee
<|endoftext|>

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution
<|endoftext|>

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea 
<|endoftext|>

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks
<|endoftext|>

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak 
<|endoftext|>

long journey back home 
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away
<|endoftext|>

April 2nd
the snow
still lying 
<|endoftext|>

two dog walkers
meet -
two conversations
<|endoftext|>

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse -
still the new shoots
<|endoftext|>

school fair
on the fireman's helmet
a faint smell of smoke
<|endoftext|>

frozen dawn
the runner recovering
in his own steam 
<|endoftext|>

morning rush hour
at the side of the road
wild damsons
<|endoftext|>

Caruso recording -
the gramophone crackle
lights the fires in his eye
<|endoftext|>

the police car slows -
suburban foxes
looting from bins
<|endoftext|>

restless -
across the summer night
siren upon siren
<|endoftext|>

still the spent firework's
cordite smell -
nest of serpents
<|endoftext|>

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line
<|endoftext|>

the name
I didn't want to see -
bitter coffee
<|endoftext|>

airborne again -
the roadkill's
feathers 
<|endoftext|>

road trip
at the end of the argument
a patch of blue
<|endoftext|>

the heather still in bloom -
we take Mum the long way
back to the hospice
<|endoftext|>

chuntering at something
the blackbird on the fence post
- election day
<|endoftext|>

weaving its way
through the rush hour traffic
a white butterfly
<|endoftext|>

bringing only
silence
the storm cloud's weight
<|endoftext|>

roadside memorial -
the faded plastic windmills
still racing
<|endoftext|>

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day
<|endoftext|>

the end of the path
darker
<|endoftext|>

 
<|endoftext|>

the smell of Iowa hogs
in Minnesota

into the cafe

dwindling bonfire
a shooting star
near Orion

A spring morning
The pond's surface blurred
By raindrops.
<|endoftext|>

cold night-
a plane blinks through
Orion's bow
<|endoftext|>

late night at the office
an exit sign floats
next to the moon
<|endoftext|>

dark tree silhouettes
low on the horizon
Orion rises
<|endoftext|>

Distant thunder
the smell of rain
before the storm.

all lit up
<|endoftext|>

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd
<|endoftext|>

a vagabond on the bench
covered with a nude girl
on the newspaper
<|endoftext|>

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen
<|endoftext|>

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide
<|endoftext|>

of the bee hive
<|endoftext|>

cloudy skies -
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower
<|endoftext|>

slicing the morning mist
in quarters

<|endoftext|>

after the long wait...
  two unattended dove eggs
      in summer rain
<|endoftext|>

from the armoire,
scent of passion in a candle
yet to be burned
<|endoftext|>

mid October
the sudden thinness
of my robe
<|endoftext|>

wood flute music
through an open window
the crow's rasp
<|endoftext|>

cold May moon... the long road stretches out of sight
<|endoftext|>

mothers' day
I let the phone ring longer
for her
<|endoftext|>

scenting two pages
of the Webster's Unabridged...
wild lilac
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's dinner
nothing on the menu
suits him
<|endoftext|>

stroke of ...
his snoring punctuated
by fireworks
<|endoftext|>

stillness...
a few flat stones
beneath the pine
<|endoftext|>

purple irises
stand still
rain or shine
<|endoftext|>

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation
<|endoftext|>

distant thoughts-
the last ember
cools
<|endoftext|>

more wine?
he places an afghan
around my shoulders
<|endoftext|>

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain
<|endoftext|>

cold May moon...
the long road stretches
out of sight 
<|endoftext|>

deeper into autumn
she aches for an honest touch
<|endoftext|>

heat storm
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance
<|endoftext|>

April shower -
last drop
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

Morning fog -
only the scent of
eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

rain all day stacks of old magazines closer to the door
<|endoftext|>

church ruins
the grace
of a butterfly
<|endoftext|>

pleasantly drunk
in the orchard
a flock of waxwings
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn
<|endoftext|>

hawk's hover -
the view of calm seas
through a gunport
<|endoftext|>

overcast night
maybe the stars burn brightly
over Gaza
<|endoftext|>

at the memorial
a hawk's cry
scatters her ashes
<|endoftext|>

forty-six years
writing my name
yellow in snow
<|endoftext|>

glimmer of revival
at the window
full moon
<|endoftext|>

sunny terrace
forget Christmas
oncoming
<|endoftext|>

on the gray tarmac
in the rain back
yellow bus
<|endoftext|>

does not make his bed
undo the
day return
<|endoftext|>

watching seagulls
search the market remains
imagine the sea
<|endoftext|>

at the other end of the world
on the train window
Race raindrops
<|endoftext|>

under the endless rain
the gray spot
the colors of the arena
<|endoftext|>

with my dad
speak to learn to grow old
- The smell of clematis
<|endoftext|>

Chat of joggers...
the heron and I
motionless
<|endoftext|>

March night
listen to the rain
crashing on the tiles
<|endoftext|>

subway platform
the beggar snores
his bottle stands
<|endoftext|>

in the middle of the night
the hum of the ventilation
between two sirens blaring
<|endoftext|>

first day of autumn
the sun hits the tile
one last time
<|endoftext|>

Lost in the hubbub
on the opposite platform
the shouting match
<|endoftext|>

anonymous signature
old pigeon footprints
the bare cement
<|endoftext|>

Monday in October
in and out of the subway
without seeing the day
<|endoftext|>

Metro Morning
this urine odor
tenacious
<|endoftext|>

red tasks first
on the hillside
sun on my cheek
<|endoftext|>

heavy sleep
after plum alcohol
collected in his garden
<|endoftext|>

breathing deeply...
that smell of woodyards
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

I saw the horizon
in the subway
in four by three
<|endoftext|>

the sound of rain
drown the echo of my footsteps
autumn morning
<|endoftext|>

from room to room
the mouse moves
without worrying about us
<|endoftext|>

iced or hot tea
I hesitate
last day of August
<|endoftext|>

it is no longer
cold tap water
heat wave
<|endoftext|>

sitting on the ground
her bare shoulder
armless
<|endoftext|>

three cardboard pieces
scattered
remains monte
<|endoftext|>

a snail adventure
the still hot asphalt
June storms
<|endoftext|>

sad sandwich
fell from a machine
soulless
<|endoftext|>

the only lights on
in a passive fight
against the darkness of the whole building
<|endoftext|>

new snow
I Almost forget
our quarrel
<|endoftext|>

shirtless window
I read haikus
summer rain
<|endoftext|>

just for a moment
the smell of pine trees
way to work
<|endoftext|>

early in the morning
looking at fog
partner after the wedding
early morning
watching the fog
after marriage
<|endoftext|>

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her
<|endoftext|>

nothing more tiring
than Being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee
<|endoftext|>

crushed mosquito
red line on the floor
subway in may
<|endoftext|>

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath
<|endoftext|>

the coin
as cold as the machine
which to me made
<|endoftext|>

Black jacket
under trees
with pink flowers
<|endoftext|>

in the train
all the scents of the morning
overshadowed by the tramp asleep
<|endoftext|>

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits
<|endoftext|>

white
the pages of my notebooks
I do not like winter
<|endoftext|>

nose in the air
fixing the invisible
bum perched
<|endoftext|>

listen to the rain
next to my phone
quiet
<|endoftext|>

at Rise
piss in the autumn wind
make a haiku
<|endoftext|>

first flakes
think of my father
on his hospital bed
<|endoftext|>

my cold bed
my skin looking hers
first flakes
<|endoftext|>

stroking the cat
a cold drop
my neck
<|endoftext|>

sad smile
the line of bum who sleeps
on the subway platform
<|endoftext|>

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light -
even fresh flowers, fade
<|endoftext|>

five star hotel -
a cockroach scurries
pool-side
<|endoftext|>

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog
<|endoftext|>

his old hands
working the soil -
smell of brewed tea
<|endoftext|>

on the clothesline
his and her shirts
side by side again
<|endoftext|>

between the mist
and the edge of the forest
a white buffalo
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
rose garden
has lost its colors 
<|endoftext|>

eerie moonlight
graveyard
of the rusted automobiles
<|endoftext|>

indian summer
first light
finds the tallest tree
<|endoftext|>

drought
no clouds
in the bird bath
<|endoftext|>

tea party over
lipstick 
smiles remain
<|endoftext|>

after the cloudburst
birdbath full
of sky again
<|endoftext|>

underside
of the flower pot
one hundred legs
<|endoftext|>

high tide
yesterday's footprints
gone
<|endoftext|>

coffee season
singing
from the trees
<|endoftext|>

no moisture
mother earths skin
has cracked
<|endoftext|>

typing small i
only because morning coffee
occupies my other hand...
<|endoftext|>

In the space-between
trees and mist
a white buffalo
<|endoftext|>

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

Mekong river
the swaying of our hammocks
<|endoftext|>

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

behind the cafe
the sound of children
or crows 
<|endoftext|>

rain scented air
a thousand frogs
croaking
<|endoftext|>

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt -
the garden blooms
with children's toys
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

autumn gale
a month's mortgage payments
scatter the lawn 
<|endoftext|>

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the pony's back
<|endoftext|>

november blossom 
a brightness to find
what might have been lost
<|endoftext|>

deep autumn
there's wind enough to winnow
wild rice
<|endoftext|>

shortening days...
the petals fall
into dust
<|endoftext|>

leaver's day
a wind too strong
for butterflies
<|endoftext|>

endless rain
christmas lights
bleed in a puddle
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon
the smell of woodsmoke fills
a wait for rain
<|endoftext|>

cider farm
a sweetness
on the breeze
<|endoftext|>

neon veil
a neighbour's lights
outshine the moon
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
determining the value
of new haiku
<|endoftext|>

yew harvest
deep hues fill
a redwing's hunger
<|endoftext|>

autumn gale
the sunflowers turn
their seedy cheeks
<|endoftext|>

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit
<|endoftext|>

it's what the sunflowers
waited for
<|endoftext|>

glinting on
a retirement card
autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

what I do

strewn down our lane

around a firefly

hidden by mist

in the headlights
<|endoftext|>

dentist's chair
counting dead flies
in the striplights

last night's hail
<|endoftext|>

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain
<|endoftext|>

perseid showers
only rain in
the night garden
<|endoftext|>

summer longing
a dampness in the washing
left out overnight
<|endoftext|>

night after night
the farm dog forgets
he knows me of old
<|endoftext|>

the uniform code
<|endoftext|>

turn down a backroad

follows the tracks

<|endoftext|>

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
... a hair in my whiskey
<|endoftext|>

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth
<|endoftext|>

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes

needed for reading my ku
without glasses

of imported oranges

in the yard

A pear
A worm's hole leaves

the smell of snow

bamboo flute
the scent
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

Ashes, what was once a man,
and the full moon.
Bright, big, yellow.
<|endoftext|>

empty room  
endless TV ads

summer's end -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying
<|endoftext|>

parking for lovers 
many crocuses between
the wheel's traces
<|endoftext|>

funeral procession
of the friend passes 
the crocus field

playing bowls,
playing at cards...
old warriors

Independence Day
after the rainy morning
a sunny afternoon
<|endoftext|>

autumn equinox 
fox's eyes shining
in the twilight
<|endoftext|>

overturned boat,
drawn high on the shore -
drumming of rain
<|endoftext|>

meteor shower 
crickets occupied
by its song
<|endoftext|>

chilly tea-time 
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.
<|endoftext|>

watching Perseids 
a moth makes noise
on the porch
<|endoftext|>

moths fluttering
in the paper lantern?
a shadow play
<|endoftext|>

nobody's here -
only a cricket guards
the alpine hut
<|endoftext|>

long lasting rain -
the dog-rose petals clung
to the pavement
<|endoftext|>

summer's end  -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying
<|endoftext|>

summer's end .
their chirping slows down -
good-bye, cicadas!
<|endoftext|>

above the cemetery
laser beams from the disco 
a calm cricket chirp
<|endoftext|>

the rose hides
the date of death
on her grave
<|endoftext|>

sultry twilight 
pauses between bird's singing
become longer
<|endoftext|>

courtyard of my childhood 
after so many dead people
the old lilac in bloom
<|endoftext|>

afternoon tea 
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter
<|endoftext|>

under floating clouds
the cherry blossom snow 
in the same direction
<|endoftext|>

I completely forgot
the magnolia-tree,
till its bloom
<|endoftext|>

I light on again
the candle on her grave
extuinguished by wind
<|endoftext|>

first crowing
breaks my sleep 
year of Rooster
<|endoftext|>

drinking mulled wine
on the square 
white breaths
<|endoftext|>

late harvester 
sickle moon in the sky
over the mature corn
<|endoftext|>

deep in the night
my computer turned off 
sound of autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

crickets' songs
in the pitch-dark night 
how many secrets
<|endoftext|>

nobody here
a table in the mountain
speckled with petals
<|endoftext|>

 trains come and go
but the same people
drinks at bar
<|endoftext|>

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus 
<|endoftext|>

little pawprints
in the concrete
from the lost kitten
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
the low from street lamps
still lingers
your late night words
suffuse my day with warmth
<|endoftext|>

before my door
your footprints in the snow
from last night
how to absorb these echoes
of what we shared
<|endoftext|>

her father's grave -
the little girl leaves a picture
of a dinosaur
<|endoftext|>

Handel's Messiah
the same tapes my late-grandmother
listened to
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon -
the fulness
of the cow's udder
<|endoftext|>

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower
<|endoftext|>

full moon
pumpkins in the field
ready to pick
<|endoftext|>

overcast-
curls of smoke
over a shared fence
<|endoftext|>

New Year's Eve
the warmth of his eyes
over cold champagne
<|endoftext|>

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful
<|endoftext|>

solstice birthday
blowing out a candle
for each decade
<|endoftext|>

overcast day...
even the poppies
stay curled up
<|endoftext|>

early dawn...
I watch the New Year
spill down the mountain
<|endoftext|>

our greeting
between the honks
returning geese
<|endoftext|>

clouds lifting
above the archipelago
morning light
<|endoftext|>

the owl's whoo
unanswered
this autumn night
<|endoftext|>

autumn morning
spreading marmalade
over burnt toast
<|endoftext|>

autumn sun
slides through the blinds
withered sunflowers
<|endoftext|>

candlelit pumpkin
the moths reflection
in the cat's eyes
<|endoftext|>

New Year's Eve
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes
<|endoftext|>

almost Christmas 
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum
<|endoftext|>

at dusk...
the sweetness
of the roses
<|endoftext|>

winter pears
eating around
the bruises
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon
the baby stirs
in her belly
<|endoftext|>

autumn deepens
dusting off an old
bottle of port
<|endoftext|>

election results
low tide clams
spit seawater
<|endoftext|>

evening walk
acorn shells crunch
into the silence
<|endoftext|>

empty bus stop
autumn leaves swirl
in the car's wake
<|endoftext|>

flu season
to kiss
or not to kiss?
<|endoftext|>

drought-
weeds sprouting
near the sprinkler
<|endoftext|>

death watch...
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris
<|endoftext|>

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein
<|endoftext|>

at the cottage...
last year's mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall
<|endoftext|>

spring cleaning...
painting over
last year's mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>

midnight.
the stallion's single kick
against the wall
<|endoftext|>

quiet stable...
the sudden force
of horse piss
<|endoftext|>

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce
<|endoftext|>

overcast -
the next door pianist
hits a sour note
<|endoftext|>

downpour -
the pumpkin's smile
goes out
<|endoftext|>

we sip sweet tea
in silence...
a soldier's mother
<|endoftext|>

autumn visit -
over war news we talk
of babies...
<|endoftext|>

fireside -
a son's face smiles down
from the mantelpiece
<|endoftext|>

setting gibbous moon a golden jellyfish drifts under our kayak
<|endoftext|>

in the yard
between our argument -
a red dragonfly
<|endoftext|>

more rain -
mildew colors
the old roof
<|endoftext|>

half asleep -
the rhythm of the
receding rain
<|endoftext|>

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable
<|endoftext|>

night rain -
Chopin's nocturne
drowns it out 
<|endoftext|>

summer rain -
lightning whites out
the street lights
<|endoftext|>

the crow -
balancing on a wire
and now, in the wind
<|endoftext|>

midnight -
only jasmine now
and cricket song
<|endoftext|>

equinox -
the bulbul's song on the edge
between day and night
<|endoftext|>

spring evening -
a boy hums the tune I heard
half a mile ago
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
a forsythia
without birds
<|endoftext|>

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight
<|endoftext|>

unaimed day -
beneath the flipped stone
five black beetles 
<|endoftext|>

cricket song
softly, outlasting
the trucks
<|endoftext|>

red poppies...
the butterfly always just
out of reach
<|endoftext|>

night silence -
despite the dogs, despite
a crying baby
<|endoftext|>

monsoon clouds - 
a heron bathes in a pool
of light
<|endoftext|>

night rain
a bat wings its way to
tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

unhurried
the egret whiter
than the clouds
<|endoftext|>

veins of lightning
split the sky - 
smell of wet earth
<|endoftext|>

moonless
suddenly the silence
bigbangs into barking
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope
<|endoftext|>

early spring air
all day long
our beds not made
<|endoftext|>

rain on leaves tiles earth

a thousand prayers
from valley folds and mountains
paper cranes

out the window
<|endoftext|>

cold nose
burrow of warm flannel -

fifty shades
of pink
<|endoftext|>

one small step...

in the birdbath
<|endoftext|>

The flash of the float plane's light
Rain on the forest 
<|endoftext|>

the courtship songs
of so many birds 
wind through my shirt
<|endoftext|>

of the first leaf
a sweet sigh
<|endoftext|>

the sound
of the first fallen leaf
this Autumn day
<|endoftext|>

another insomnia night
<|endoftext|>

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day
<|endoftext|>

He looks at her
underlying chill in the air
smell of rain
<|endoftext|>

Another day without him

still, the sun shines
<|endoftext|>

thoughts of him
crowd my brain
and takes my sleep 
<|endoftext|>

day breaking from the night
a seaplane is waiting
<|endoftext|>

float in and out
red seaweed 
<|endoftext|>

Counting the shades
of grey in the sea
and in his hair
Comptant les teintes
de gris de la mer
et de ses cheveux 
<|endoftext|>

scent of rain 
a whale-shaped cloud
hangs over the bay
<|endoftext|>

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring
<|endoftext|>

Dusting off the ancestors
and stirring up memories
Spring cleaning
<|endoftext|>

Another day of rain
her tears fall also
which is which
<|endoftext|>

waiting for the sun
the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room
<|endoftext|>

Cancer clinic visit
a bald woman passes by
with a smile
<|endoftext|>

a milky sea
mass of logs sit and rest
as an eagle soars 
<|endoftext|>

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face
<|endoftext|>

From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace
Today's lunch
<|endoftext|>

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls
<|endoftext|>

lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds 
spring dreaming
<|endoftext|>

Dawn
The night separating from the day
A bird's song
<|endoftext|>

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent
<|endoftext|>

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain
<|endoftext|>

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand
<|endoftext|>

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex
<|endoftext|>

Soft rain
My Mother and I look
At retirement homes
<|endoftext|>

Rainy February day
Cloud after cloud after cloud
Pray for a clear day
<|endoftext|>

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind
<|endoftext|>

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono
<|endoftext|>

Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese
Spring is here
<|endoftext|>

a cold morning 
goose honks echo
off the pavement
<|endoftext|>

Snowballs
her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one
<|endoftext|>

Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window 
Advents candles blow out
<|endoftext|>

Winter solstice

this shortest of days
<|endoftext|>

On the island
the first snowfall
red gloves
<|endoftext|>

First mandarin
sweet and sour taste
scent of Christmas
<|endoftext|>

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you
<|endoftext|>

A wind up frog
hops across the wooden floor
thoughts of haiku 
<|endoftext|>

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumn's abundance
<|endoftext|>

Summer's day
the clink of ice cubes
in my gin and tonic
<|endoftext|>

Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns
this Autumn day 
<|endoftext|>

steamed milk 
snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof
<|endoftext|>

Rain clouds
patches of blue in the sky
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

In the morning darkness
coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine
<|endoftext|>

Fall morning
fog resting on cedars
cup of Kona
<|endoftext|>

Fall afternoon
the boat on the river
slow heart beating
<|endoftext|>

Hazy skies
the cedars less dark
this Summer day
<|endoftext|>

Crickets in the garden
time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands 
<|endoftext|>

My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away 
<|endoftext|>

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles
<|endoftext|>

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

(Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain
<|endoftext|>

conformation
the steady drip...drip...drip...drip...
of maple sap 
<|endoftext|>

between the yoga
and chi gung classes 
scent of burning sage
<|endoftext|>

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes
<|endoftext|>

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money
<|endoftext|>

After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter
<|endoftext|>

The red breasted bird
outside the cancer clinic 
Spring nest building now 
<|endoftext|>

Dark spring morning
busy conversation of birds
awakens interest
<|endoftext|>

Morning sunshine bright
chases all worry from cancer
operation success 
<|endoftext|>

Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow
<|endoftext|>

A float plane
divides the Canada geese
Summer stillness
<|endoftext|>

Summer solstice
the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill
<|endoftext|>

Spring cleaning today
dead ladybug on the window
memory of lost love
<|endoftext|>

dawn storm 
a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow
<|endoftext|>

Cold sea
and warm air merge
fog horns
<|endoftext|>

scent of seaweed
drifts into the cemetery
i walk alone
<|endoftext|>

In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops
<|endoftext|>

a slow walk
to the cemetery
memory of blue irises 
<|endoftext|>

Through the fog
a few spots of red
first Robins
<|endoftext|>

Old chestnut tree
white candles sway
Spring wind
<|endoftext|>

Ides of March
her letter to him
pain in his heart
<|endoftext|>

Lights of the ferry 
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow
<|endoftext|>

The full December moon
he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple
<|endoftext|>

The Advent wreath
candles lighting the dim room
his old eyes shinning
<|endoftext|>

horizonless 
sky-colored ice
turns in the bay
<|endoftext|>

November morning 
counting the many
shades  of grey
<|endoftext|>

Chilly morning 
mountains topped with first snow
warm coffee cup
<|endoftext|>

Snow covered temple 
lone woman in a red coat
kneels to pray anyway
<|endoftext|>

Indian Summer 
his voice in the fall
of the leaves
<|endoftext|>

Through the  pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing 
Start of a sunrise
<|endoftext|>

The rushing river 
full of the Summer's
rainfall
<|endoftext|>

The Budapest square 
Autumn leaves drift  here and there
on  young protestors
<|endoftext|>

Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg 
her shadow trailing
<|endoftext|>

Summer morning 
the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony
<|endoftext|>

This Dark and grey day 
a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses
<|endoftext|>

sharp air 
the patch of blue
changes shape
<|endoftext|>

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back
<|endoftext|>

Rain-laden cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose
<|endoftext|>

On this dark grey day
my thoughts wander to a pair
of  blue irises
<|endoftext|>

A bone scan today
on the way three birds on the
rose scented old path
<|endoftext|>

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in
<|endoftext|>

Late night jazz
the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe
<|endoftext|>

the voice of the singer
looks black
in the smoky cafe
<|endoftext|>

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top, the cat
<|endoftext|>

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound 
making my bed
<|endoftext|>

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu
<|endoftext|>

daylight moon 
the shadows of bubbles
under the ice
<|endoftext|>

Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday
<|endoftext|>

In the early morning
down on the white beach 
a turtle without eyes
<|endoftext|>

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts
<|endoftext|>

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall
<|endoftext|>

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you
<|endoftext|>

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent
<|endoftext|>

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence
<|endoftext|>

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day 
International Women's Day
<|endoftext|>

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow
<|endoftext|>

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm
<|endoftext|>

fog patches 
a second little face
in the sonogram
<|endoftext|>

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns
<|endoftext|>

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn
<|endoftext|>

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses
<|endoftext|>

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground
<|endoftext|>

Spring day
cool and grey
cup of tea
<|endoftext|>

Grey today
the waves rush
memories
<|endoftext|>

Spring morning
your hand on my breast
a bird
<|endoftext|>

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound
<|endoftext|>

Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves
<|endoftext|>

Autumn sky
shades of pink and purple
field of pumkins
<|endoftext|>

snow flakes swirl outside
the laundromat
<|endoftext|>

First day of autumn
splash of a spawning salmon
another cycle begins
<|endoftext|>

Last day of September
bay and islands in fog
aroma of coffee
<|endoftext|>

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace
<|endoftext|>

A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses
<|endoftext|>

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow
<|endoftext|>

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air
<|endoftext|>

Over the bay
August full moon rises
as days shorten
<|endoftext|>

Reading a book
a sudden brightness
the full moon
<|endoftext|>

High winds
trees down on power lines
no morning coffee
<|endoftext|>

On a grey day
a spot of colour
his red hair
<|endoftext|>

lifting fog 
a few white feathers
in the raven's breast
<|endoftext|>

In the room
white lillies in the vase
scent of pepper
<|endoftext|>

Federal Express
reaches me through the fog
plumeria lei
<|endoftext|>

Talking with you
now this morning somehow
scent of plumeria
<|endoftext|>

Red as the poppy
maple leaves fall
on the memorial
<|endoftext|>

Light-studded ferry
passes in the starless night
another week-end
<|endoftext|>

A tunnel of fog
connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet
<|endoftext|>

October morning
a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet
<|endoftext|>

First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler
<|endoftext|>

Last night of Summer
the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud
<|endoftext|>

All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

bank thermometers 
the temperature changes
all the way home
<|endoftext|>

The sunrise
fresh salmon on ice
so very pink
<|endoftext|>

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner
<|endoftext|>

The blue iris
colour changing hue
soft Summer rain
<|endoftext|>

A sea change
the weather turns cool
hot rum and lemon
<|endoftext|>

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water
<|endoftext|>

In this desert
a memory of blue sea 
shells in the sand
<|endoftext|>

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses
<|endoftext|>

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines
<|endoftext|>

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay
<|endoftext|>

subzero 
the icicles filled
with moonlight
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues
<|endoftext|>

The curved cheek
of the young monk

in the rainforest
drip, drip, drip
<|endoftext|>

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts
<|endoftext|>

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses
<|endoftext|>

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises
<|endoftext|>

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift
<|endoftext|>

Wind howls and
the cedars sway 
drunken sailors
<|endoftext|>

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages 
haijin's notebook
<|endoftext|>

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters
<|endoftext|>

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's
eerie silence
<|endoftext|>

long cold snap 
the icicle
begins to fork
<|endoftext|>

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs
<|endoftext|>

one hundred views
of the sunrise -
appartment block
<|endoftext|>

predawn
a grey dove outside
my window
<|endoftext|>

solstice
a shaft of sunlight
through rock
<|endoftext|>

rainburst
thoughts of you
fading
<|endoftext|>

straw hat -
flowers fading
under the sun
<|endoftext|>

New sheets.
I remember
your hands.
<|endoftext|>

shaking the stone from her shoe -
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts
<|endoftext|>

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze
<|endoftext|>

soft jazz
candle light and lip gloss
in the corner 
<|endoftext|>

low clouds 
a gull circles above
the police car light
<|endoftext|>

Earth Day...
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect
<|endoftext|>

August 6
my father does not say
good morning
<|endoftext|>

cloudburst 
the last nail hammered 
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
the chalkboard screeches
at her touch 
<|endoftext|>

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk
<|endoftext|>

snow flurries :::
a blue jay's feather
clings to the yard 
<|endoftext|>

snow glare
onion bulbs sprouting 
from the bag
<|endoftext|>

geriatric ward
the table groans
when they fold it up
<|endoftext|>

sun dog
so many names
carved on the cliff 
<|endoftext|>

snowy banks 
the drifting duck leans
into a curve
<|endoftext|>

Easter
an anxious mother calls
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

breathless 
camellias falling
one by one
<|endoftext|>

Las Vegas spills
over the desert
<|endoftext|>

a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden

Pittsburgh and heaven
<|endoftext|>

a long split
in the black inky cap 
snow clouds
<|endoftext|>

on the roof late 
my brother hammers nails
in the moon
<|endoftext|>

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling 
<|endoftext|>

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes
<|endoftext|>

the heat...
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite
<|endoftext|>

fireworks over...
the silence
of the stars
<|endoftext|>

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars
<|endoftext|>

dusk
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam
<|endoftext|>

monsoon season raindrops dot the dust
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began
<|endoftext|>

drifting from dream to dream hazy moon
<|endoftext|>

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar
<|endoftext|>

children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

her obituary...
the things we did
that summer
<|endoftext|>

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt...
my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylark's song
<|endoftext|>

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer
<|endoftext|>

season's end

drifts downstream
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes
<|endoftext|>

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems
<|endoftext|>

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve
<|endoftext|>

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall 
<|endoftext|>

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift
<|endoftext|>

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight
<|endoftext|>

as old as I feel
on a gray morning...
autumn equinox
<|endoftext|>

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight
<|endoftext|>

new coolness 
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch
<|endoftext|>

awake
in the dark
the darkness
<|endoftext|>

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly
<|endoftext|>

coming home...
the scent of the ocean
before the sound
<|endoftext|>

Labor Day

the leftovers
<|endoftext|>

of a rope
<|endoftext|>

where the bookstore
used to be
<|endoftext|>

at my name tag 
<|endoftext|>

Easter vigil

a cloud of gnats
<|endoftext|>

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop
<|endoftext|>

almost spring

by the wind
<|endoftext|>

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox
<|endoftext|>

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight
<|endoftext|>

waving goodnight
after the party

to my childhood

undone

in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

running uphill . . 
Gettysburg
<|endoftext|>

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter...

<|endoftext|>

evening rain
she lets down
her hair
<|endoftext|>

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow
<|endoftext|>

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret
<|endoftext|>

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach
<|endoftext|>

how quickly
the nights grow longer 
fireweed in bloom
<|endoftext|>

a few petals
left by the sweeper...
sunset clouds
<|endoftext|>

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils
<|endoftext|>

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions
<|endoftext|>

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

powdering the dog

go to heaven
<|endoftext|>

in her hair

to mine
<|endoftext|>

my first love
<|endoftext|>

as I reach amen

rises from the mud
<|endoftext|>

- the unspoken words
<|endoftext|>

dusk-

on the rocking chair
<|endoftext|>

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat
<|endoftext|>

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights
<|endoftext|>

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response
<|endoftext|>

A red berry falls
Staining the snow 
A silent sunset.
<|endoftext|>

This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.
<|endoftext|>

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor
<|endoftext|>

Post Office 
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms
<|endoftext|>

with a cracked head on display
no buyers
<|endoftext|>

lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign
<|endoftext|>

a new month - 
different seeds 
on the spaniel's ears 
<|endoftext|>

ah these short nights
hardly time to see
seeds up
<|endoftext|>

a leaf in the wind over a long
stem

the funeral of thirty one
December 2004

she watches the needle
penetrate his flesh

of rain
<|endoftext|>

moss growing
on the manhole cover 
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind? 
<|endoftext|>

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer
<|endoftext|>

apple core
how to bottle
memories
<|endoftext|>

though touch-less
the intimate rustle of silk 
<|endoftext|>

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front 
<|endoftext|>

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes 
<|endoftext|>

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane
<|endoftext|>

her prying glance
through the mist
<|endoftext|>

news of his death 
I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon

of bells 
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids
<|endoftext|>

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word
<|endoftext|>

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist
<|endoftext|>

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's
cough louder
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp
<|endoftext|>

pine strand
flailing in night sky-
the first low star
<|endoftext|>

twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake
somehow smaller
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones
<|endoftext|>

opaque windows 
barring the dawn 
of the new year
<|endoftext|>

even seagulls 
imitate the stones 
first frost
<|endoftext|>

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes
<|endoftext|>

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths
<|endoftext|>

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand
<|endoftext|>

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer

crocus buds
secrets we've kept
from each other
<|endoftext|>

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight
the Milky Way
<|endoftext|>

winter sky
the white cat's eyes
bluer
<|endoftext|>

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox
<|endoftext|>

the coming of summer-
all the petals
i brushed off my hair
<|endoftext|>

gray spring dawn-
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones
<|endoftext|>

this cold-
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window
<|endoftext|>

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on-
my indecisions
<|endoftext|>

watching rain
drum beat on window pane
the deaf cat
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
shoots among the lilies
she can't name
<|endoftext|>

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes
<|endoftext|>

mirror
her mother's lips
pursing like hers
<|endoftext|>

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail
<|endoftext|>

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave
<|endoftext|>

silence -
the evening snow falls
onto moss
<|endoftext|>

secrets
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight
<|endoftext|>

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms
<|endoftext|>

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts
<|endoftext|>

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus
<|endoftext|>

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee
<|endoftext|>

deep winter
nothing much to say
even among crows
<|endoftext|>

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one
<|endoftext|>

the last of the roses
have lost their names
<|endoftext|>

in her father's shadow
lost too soon

from a ragged leaf
<|endoftext|>

blizzard-

our locked hands 
<|endoftext|>

first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers
<|endoftext|>

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call
<|endoftext|>

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials 
<|endoftext|>

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle
<|endoftext|>

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain
<|endoftext|>

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku
<|endoftext|>

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars 
<|endoftext|>

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows 
<|endoftext|>

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal 
<|endoftext|>

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth
<|endoftext|>

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed
<|endoftext|>

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles
<|endoftext|>

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail
<|endoftext|>

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning
<|endoftext|>

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon
<|endoftext|>

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence
<|endoftext|>

cloudy day
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web
<|endoftext|>

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders
<|endoftext|>

stripping off
her sweatshirt 
sparks in the dark
<|endoftext|>

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow
<|endoftext|>

noon 
the morning clouds
roll from the valley
<|endoftext|>

trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush
<|endoftext|>

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?
<|endoftext|>

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening
<|endoftext|>

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green
<|endoftext|>

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for 
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot

Coyotes howling in the night 
Honking, geese at dawn

Like Custer's bugler,
you sound the charge. Remember
the Little Big Horn.

Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars
<|endoftext|>

If you really love
America hang that flag 
on a bicycle

my first white hairs

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon –
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden
<|endoftext|>

autumn bonfire –
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke
<|endoftext|>

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern
<|endoftext|>

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table
<|endoftext|>

the winter sun 
in the cancer ward -
a quiet old couple
<|endoftext|>

old pond -
another lily
in bloom
<|endoftext|>

One just sits
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.
<|endoftext|>

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise.

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs
<|endoftext|>

spring moonset 
a rice ball for
breakfast
<|endoftext|>

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon
<|endoftext|>

Eating alone 
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.
<|endoftext|>

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam
<|endoftext|>

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news
<|endoftext|>

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms
<|endoftext|>

left padlocked
under streetlight
orion's bike 
<|endoftext|>

past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds
<|endoftext|>

christmas lights...
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese
<|endoftext|>

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples
<|endoftext|>

boardwalking
the dragonfly's shadow
drops through a crack
<|endoftext|>

another day
another apple crumble
... autumn deepens 
<|endoftext|>

Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have
<|endoftext|>

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples
<|endoftext|>

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks
<|endoftext|>

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars
<|endoftext|>

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot
<|endoftext|>

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener
<|endoftext|>

double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night
<|endoftext|>

i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill
<|endoftext|>

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light
<|endoftext|>

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky  some
passing clouds
<|endoftext|>

leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose
<|endoftext|>

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
rides had been
<|endoftext|>

two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river
<|endoftext|>

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars 
<|endoftext|>

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze
<|endoftext|>

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell 
<|endoftext|>

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear
<|endoftext|>

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls 
<|endoftext|>

Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen
<|endoftext|>

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swan's whiteness
<|endoftext|>

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home
<|endoftext|>

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase
<|endoftext|>

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase
<|endoftext|>

no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page
<|endoftext|>

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine
<|endoftext|>

unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles
<|endoftext|>

hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver
<|endoftext|>

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels
<|endoftext|>

faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves
<|endoftext|>

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet
<|endoftext|>

April -
a gull's cry passing
through morning snow
<|endoftext|>

rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin 
<|endoftext|>

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles
<|endoftext|>

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another
<|endoftext|>

i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over
<|endoftext|>

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane
<|endoftext|>

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed
<|endoftext|>

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death
<|endoftext|>

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run
<|endoftext|>

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard
<|endoftext|>

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn
<|endoftext|>

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train
<|endoftext|>

in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world
<|endoftext|>

somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home
<|endoftext|>

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night
<|endoftext|>

into the space between thoughts falling rose petals
<|endoftext|>

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose
<|endoftext|>

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall
<|endoftext|>

starless night
the cyclist
without lights
<|endoftext|>

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice
<|endoftext|>

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.
<|endoftext|>

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier
<|endoftext|>

muggy night opening another window to let in more insects
<|endoftext|>

sunglassesheadphones  the world beyond
<|endoftext|>

a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise
<|endoftext|>

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog
<|endoftext|>

grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence
<|endoftext|>

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e 
<|endoftext|>

sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career
<|endoftext|>

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase
<|endoftext|>

water changing
into ice 
the pale moon
<|endoftext|>

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone
<|endoftext|>

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails
<|endoftext|>

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber
<|endoftext|>

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind...
elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest
<|endoftext|>

in the grey of relentless rain 
his shaved cranium and huge red headphones
<|endoftext|>

on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here
<|endoftext|>

new moon i hear about it first via twitter
<|endoftext|>

red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened
<|endoftext|>

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

hazy afternoon
the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice
<|endoftext|>

her skin flickers in television light rain on the window
<|endoftext|>

the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile
<|endoftext|>

hard frost -
deep in my coat pocket
summer sea-glass
<|endoftext|>

that same music
again and again
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog
<|endoftext|>

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti
<|endoftext|>

still life -
at the lake's edge a tree's reflection
caught in the ice
<|endoftext|>

november sun -
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice

hangs over the valley

white clouds drift
in the August sky,
a child dreams
<|endoftext|>

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide
<|endoftext|>

restless night
the morning starts
without me
<|endoftext|>

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January
<|endoftext|>

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg
<|endoftext|>

A lull in the storm 
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.
<|endoftext|>

The thyme
has gone to seed 
summer's end.
<|endoftext|>

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine

falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit
<|endoftext|>

In front of bronze doors
They huddle Against the Cold

up to the shadows
<|endoftext|>

Mid morning coffee
sipped from a chipped mug old
so comforting
<|endoftext|>

Rainbows reflected
in So Many potholes

before has flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway

of cold autumn rain

settles deep
inside my breasts
<|endoftext|>

Cracks on a sidewalk
Lost Among the grass and weeds

Sentinels of spring...
kites bobbing for care
saucy winds in March

Gleaners harvest moon
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field
<|endoftext|>

at the fish market

the fence
<|endoftext|>

spitting seeds
into a blue Sky-
the old elm
<|endoftext|>

Forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

just over the fence

trucks and
<|endoftext|>

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice
<|endoftext|>

unexpected guest-
a thought out cam
of nowhere
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain

Across the field

A cold morning
the pink of tulips
through the mist.

in neon, the
scent of jasmine

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk
<|endoftext|>

winter rain

all over again
<|endoftext|>

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
how sudden this stillness then
and now how I have missed you
<|endoftext|>

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end
<|endoftext|>

lanternless night...
a whisper passing
through leaves
<|endoftext|>

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
in this circular motion
hear the laughter of children
<|endoftext|>

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
how like a fine mist that fades
this future now so fragile
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
the tenderness
of light
<|endoftext|>

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window
<|endoftext|>

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades
<|endoftext|>

how tenuous time now seems
slipping away
from my reach
<|endoftext|>

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air
<|endoftext|>

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know
<|endoftext|>

funeral -
stuck in an antique vase
bubble
<|endoftext|>

autumn rains
on the way to the old house
new banks
<|endoftext|>

file -
between my car stereo
two transmitters
<|endoftext|>

a slower
moon this evening...
the cold!
<|endoftext|>

the last leaf -
his white breath dissolves
in the garden
<|endoftext|>

Indian summer
takes the wheel
counter clockwise
<|endoftext|>

of the bed

on a wall
<|endoftext|>

reflection in the window
his weeping face -
thud of rain
<|endoftext|>

at the end of the day
the shade of the oak cross
the village street
<|endoftext|>

Asked about Le Monde
glasses upside -
how tired!
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving Day
delicate aroma of turkey -
sky scorched from Iraq
<|endoftext|>

out of the metro
face to face with the moon -
return from work
<|endoftext|>

full moon
above the skyscrapers -
it's midnight
<|endoftext|>

the egg seller...
her cracked hands
speak of winter
<|endoftext|>

to November
trumpets of death -
five or six
<|endoftext|>

Day of Thanksgiving -
bountiful harvest
bought cheaply
<|endoftext|>

in frosted glass
a star cluster
<|endoftext|>

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit Slower
<|endoftext|>

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife
<|endoftext|>

putting a cork
In last night's wine
late autumn
<|endoftext|>

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
Some counting fireflies
more than once
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers
<|endoftext|>

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot
<|endoftext|>

high noon...
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror
<|endoftext|>

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air
<|endoftext|>

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus
<|endoftext|>

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice
<|endoftext|>

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot
<|endoftext|>

my wife
home from hospital

<|endoftext|>

My 72nd winter

in every room 
<|endoftext|>

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend

<|endoftext|>

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom
<|endoftext|>

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday
<|endoftext|>

after the storm,
an egret fording
darkness
<|endoftext|>

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers
<|endoftext|>

despite my assurances
my wife's makeup
thicker
<|endoftext|>

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow
<|endoftext|>

despite the day's heat
mum's tombstone
so cold
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises
<|endoftext|>

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night
<|endoftext|>

late night rain
the crickets finally
silent
<|endoftext|>

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight 
<|endoftext|>

sunset traffic
slowly down the hill
into darkness
<|endoftext|>

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction
<|endoftext|>

early spring...
young women collecting
peach blossoms
<|endoftext|>

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends
<|endoftext|>

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle
<|endoftext|>

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain 
<|endoftext|>

silent night
the fog thick
at every window
<|endoftext|>

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus
<|endoftext|>

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words
<|endoftext|>

while making love
the last icicle
falls
<|endoftext|>

bad news from home
the cold morning
colder still
<|endoftext|>

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day
<|endoftext|>

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

after midnight...
a shooting star beneath
the wharf
<|endoftext|>

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up
<|endoftext|>

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer
<|endoftext|>

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree
<|endoftext|>

63 today
nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds
<|endoftext|>

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend
<|endoftext|>

summer solstice    the wind still cold
<|endoftext|>

right after
morning prayers
distant thunder
<|endoftext|>

mountain storm
somewhere during its echo
the thunder ends
<|endoftext|>

60 today
the full moon
still rising
<|endoftext|>

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong
<|endoftext|>

mid-summer...
she shares with me
a ripe melon!
<|endoftext|>

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn
<|endoftext|>

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine
<|endoftext|>

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears
<|endoftext|>

death
of an old friend
my cup empty
<|endoftext|>

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues
<|endoftext|>

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness
<|endoftext|>

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog
<|endoftext|>

spring breeze
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose
<|endoftext|>

bedtime 
trying not to count
maimed solders
<|endoftext|>

indian summer
the viagra stock
deflates
<|endoftext|>

no longer a
mirror, this lake chasing
geese into darkness
<|endoftext|>

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha
<|endoftext|>

Fly,
be afraid!
No Buddhists in this house!
<|endoftext|>

after the fireworks... the thunder moon
<|endoftext|>

huddled cows
their steam thickens
the valley mist 
<|endoftext|>

for a moment
the gull in the air
is very white
<|endoftext|>

leap year
looking a her twins
a squinting woman 
<|endoftext|>

less cars
in front of the brothels
valentine's day 
<|endoftext|>

on my smartphone
mount fuji in the sunset
morning coffee 
<|endoftext|>

after the bell
just the rain on the umbrellas
ashes to ashes 
<|endoftext|>

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears
cold rain
<|endoftext|>

almost summer...
eating an especially
ripe mango
<|endoftext|>

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds
<|endoftext|>

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow 
<|endoftext|>

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star 
<|endoftext|>

more piercing
in the autumn mist
the blackbird's song
<|endoftext|>

asleep
a golden dot on her ear
bus forty one
<|endoftext|>

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent
<|endoftext|>

March morning
look eastward

<|endoftext|>

the silence
of the rain april

Winter storm
a drop through the window
Drop by drop
<|endoftext|>

Gusts of wind
dancing together under
a harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

autumn sun
the footsteps of my father
slower
<|endoftext|>

a darkest point
in the snow ultrasound
full autumn moon
<|endoftext|>

full moon
after the pumpkin soup
more rounded belly
<|endoftext|>

in the fog
My breath is lost
the evening train
<|endoftext|>

on the bridge
people hurry
summer rain
<|endoftext|>

snowfall
the tea bag sinks
slowly in water
<|endoftext|>

in my palm
her bigger breasts
winter sun
<|endoftext|>

December evening
on the ultrasound screen
as snow
<|endoftext|>

twilight winter
the shadow of the scarecrow
beyond the scope
<|endoftext|>

slowly
advance beetle
June storm
<|endoftext|>

the fullness
of ripe melons...
this summer moon
<|endoftext|>

full moon
the shadow of her breasts
lands on me
<|endoftext|>

Back to School
still a bit high tide
near dunes
<|endoftext|>

on the dog's carcass
the first flies
<|endoftext|>

low tide -
quartered in the fort
the corpse of a dog
<|endoftext|>

sunset
on the fourth glass
the trace of a bird
<|endoftext|>

under cassiopée
a cricket
<|endoftext|>

Around the Moon
Slowly, the fog
above crickets
<|endoftext|>

watch the moon
move behind the oak
Summer Wind
<|endoftext|>

calm water
two swans frolic

<|endoftext|>

Autumn freshness
to feed a child
eighty years
<|endoftext|>

on my keyboard
<|endoftext|>

partner after the fireworks
he marvels
at the moon
<|endoftext|>

five am
behind the thick fog
the smell of fresh bread
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
the look of love of mother
for his daughter who recites
<|endoftext|>

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds
<|endoftext|>

on the neck
the scent of her hands
drink greedily
<|endoftext|>

a pen in hand
it has its drain
and I its strengths
<|endoftext|>

like last year
cherry blossoms
hides buildings
<|endoftext|>

open the window
and smell the white lilac
hatched tonight
<|endoftext|>

first day of spring
stubborn icicles
still hang on
<|endoftext|>

daybreak
your kiss on the lip
of a coffee cup
<|endoftext|>

ripples in the sand
and then round in water
low tide and then high
<|endoftext|>

fresh autumn breeze
or the advance of age?
forgotten tea...

i am wrapped in quietness
of cottonwood seeds
<|endoftext|>

back and forth
slowly grinding ink
the weight of my words
<|endoftext|>

spring nightfall
ink melts
stone over
<|endoftext|>

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars
<|endoftext|>

fogged window
a blend of green and gray -
hot tea with milk
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
dissolving cypress -
sfumato
<|endoftext|>

slice of moon

into thick darkness
<|endoftext|>

in a grocery cart

contemplating
nightfall
the stone buddha
<|endoftext|>

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats
<|endoftext|>

between two rivers,
the echo of
his mallet
<|endoftext|>

sunday afternoon
a steam train
pushes back the fog
<|endoftext|>

eating rice
how many stars are
in the sky?
<|endoftext|>

falling leaves
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed
<|endoftext|>

biting his nails,
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

burning leaves
this foggy evening
two kinds of smoke

waiting for winter

scooping steamed rice,
the laborer
at sundown
<|endoftext|>

windswept afternoon
tea scent
on my tongue
<|endoftext|>

thank you, mango
for a moment i was
somewhere else
<|endoftext|>

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night
<|endoftext|>

reoccurrence
of cancer 
no spring this year
<|endoftext|>

gentle
on my window
summer rain
and his whispers rising
falling, rising...
<|endoftext|>

in memory of Quentin Crisp:
<|endoftext|>

season of mists...
a calling of wild geese
arrows south
<|endoftext|>

afternoon card parties
the rumor mill's
farm system 
<|endoftext|>

amber leaves
caught between 'for sale'
and 'sold'
<|endoftext|>

again and again -
news of his wife's death
<|endoftext|>

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo
<|endoftext|>

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha
<|endoftext|>

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter
<|endoftext|>

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again
<|endoftext|>

winter ennui... 
coming down with a slight 
touch of clouds 
<|endoftext|>

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples...
orchard fog
<|endoftext|>

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee 
<|endoftext|>

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back
<|endoftext|>

recycling
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill
<|endoftext|>

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon
<|endoftext|>

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl
<|endoftext|>

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table
<|endoftext|>

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee
<|endoftext|>

a touch 
of bluegrass...
spring 
<|endoftext|>

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain
<|endoftext|>

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow...
hot cocoa 
<|endoftext|>

cutting flowers...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space
<|endoftext|>

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book
<|endoftext|>

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep
<|endoftext|>

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift
<|endoftext|>

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide 
<|endoftext|>

another way out...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind 
<|endoftext|>

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there
<|endoftext|>

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon
<|endoftext|>

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek 
<|endoftext|>

wolf call
in the distance...
ice moon
<|endoftext|>

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below
<|endoftext|>

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone
<|endoftext|>

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to
<|endoftext|>

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts
<|endoftext|>

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

red sky-
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers
<|endoftext|>

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time
<|endoftext|>

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay
<|endoftext|>

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking
<|endoftext|>

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear
<|endoftext|>

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain
<|endoftext|>

that cricket -
it's THERE
or THERE! 
<|endoftext|>

avalanche warnings -
more tails of rain
and radiation 
<|endoftext|>

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain
<|endoftext|>

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid
<|endoftext|>

sleet ticking windows
the chemo drip
in its last hour
<|endoftext|>

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock
<|endoftext|>

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves
<|endoftext|>

midsummer morning
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor 
<|endoftext|>

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes
chilled wind
<|endoftext|>

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet
<|endoftext|>

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly
<|endoftext|>

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain
<|endoftext|>

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds
<|endoftext|>

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom
<|endoftext|>

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night
<|endoftext|>

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green
<|endoftext|>

that long-ago kiss
and still Orion strides
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

bitter cold
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food
<|endoftext|>

deepening snow
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland
<|endoftext|>

warmed-over coffee
the gray gray sound
of winter rain
<|endoftext|>

3:00 a.m.
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon
<|endoftext|>

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars
<|endoftext|>

sipping fresh cider
both dippers
among the far stars
<|endoftext|>

cool morning
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog
<|endoftext|>

meditation room
books of wisdom
lean left... and right
<|endoftext|>

turning north
sand from both oceans
in little jars
<|endoftext|>

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn
<|endoftext|>

nearly 60 
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed
<|endoftext|>

a B-52
thunders over the bay
blue heron lifting
<|endoftext|>

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses
<|endoftext|>

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac
<|endoftext|>

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms
<|endoftext|>

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light
<|endoftext|>

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag 
<|endoftext|>

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain
<|endoftext|>

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web
<|endoftext|>

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth
<|endoftext|>

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side
<|endoftext|>

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse
<|endoftext|>

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking
<|endoftext|>

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset
<|endoftext|>

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors
<|endoftext|>

falling leaves more of the sky
<|endoftext|>

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk
<|endoftext|>

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent
<|endoftext|>

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple
<|endoftext|>

open windows -
all the contrails
feathering
<|endoftext|>

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name
<|endoftext|>

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning
<|endoftext|>

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds
<|endoftext|>

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest
<|endoftext|>

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark
<|endoftext|>

Satie -
the rain
eases
<|endoftext|>

Chinese market -
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile
<|endoftext|>

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land
<|endoftext|>

strategic plan -
the sound of distant
foghorns
<|endoftext|>

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road
<|endoftext|>

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime
<|endoftext|>

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day -
recycling
old gold
<|endoftext|>

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light
<|endoftext|>

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair
<|endoftext|>

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages
<|endoftext|>

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull
<|endoftext|>

between
the Prime Minister's words
birdsong
<|endoftext|>

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky
<|endoftext|>

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose
<|endoftext|>

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface
<|endoftext|>

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous
<|endoftext|>

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist
<|endoftext|>

moon and mist 
night settles into silence
and white breath
<|endoftext|>

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash 
<|endoftext|>

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
... again and again...
<|endoftext|>

summer sunset
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows
<|endoftext|>

young girls in fog 
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco
<|endoftext|>

Chechnya 
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering
<|endoftext|>

new leaves
pattered by rain...
cardinal song
<|endoftext|>

new year...
a magpie turns over
an old leaf
<|endoftext|>

chirping birds 
the instant I press
the stop button
<|endoftext|>

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home
<|endoftext|>

examinations...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

marble moon...
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour
<|endoftext|>

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party
<|endoftext|>

sampling my husband's
home-made wine...
autumn evening
<|endoftext|>

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a far-away land
<|endoftext|>

at the window
the drumming of rain...
I catch up on sleep
<|endoftext|>

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china
<|endoftext|>

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV
<|endoftext|>

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid
<|endoftext|>

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies
<|endoftext|>

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green
<|endoftext|>

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog
<|endoftext|>

night of meteorites 
enjoying the sound of rain
instead
<|endoftext|>

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north
<|endoftext|>

in winter's wind
the call of a friend
who now has cancer
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
i gather my thoughts
for winter
<|endoftext|>

autumn melancholy
