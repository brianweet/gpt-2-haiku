jesus smiles grabs his guitar and plays
a couple of familiar riffs crooning take it
take another little piece of my heart now baby
<|endoftext|>

after a flying ovation she realizes
she is not with the kozmic blues band or
big brother and the holding company
<|endoftext|>

you do a lot more talking in your sleep
than you used to do now you're growing old
i wonder what there is for me to keep
<|endoftext|>

look back: you see the path we chose was steep
and needed all our strength  but we were bold
it took our breath and left us only sleep
<|endoftext|>

there was a time when talk of love came cheap
and what was bought was what the other sold
there was so much we didn't think to keep
<|endoftext|>

if all those words were piled up in a heap
of gold like tokens of love bright and cold
would you desire them or ask for sleep
<|endoftext|>

only know you've been high when you're feeling low
disgust the road when you're missing' home
only know you love her when you let her go
<|endoftext|>

t
s
eliot would've been ashamed of me
<|endoftext|>

nothing is past nothing is lost
one brief moment and all will be as it was before
how we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again
<|endoftext|>

father breath once more farewell
birth you gave was no thing ill
my heart is still as time will tell
<|endoftext|>

your eyes were fixed
staring at nothing and
turning into pale blue
<|endoftext|>

the funeral is sad and i cry even though i never knew the boy in the coffini cry because things have to end
why can't they be endless
i cry cause death is heart-breakingi cry for his family's pain
<|endoftext|>

crumbled lives
never to be again
scattered like leaves
<|endoftext|>

cute and hot
mountain and beaches
rose gold and the color of peaches
<|endoftext|>

o soft and dainty maiden from afar
i watch you as amidst the flowers you move
and pluck them singing
<|endoftext|>

more golden than all gold your tresses are
never was harp-note like your voice my love
your voice sweet-ringing
<|endoftext|>

they have been whispering in my ears
besides my heart doth presume
as thou art my life's pearl
<|endoftext|>

locked up in passion
never make a promise
but i'll be what he
<|endoftext|>

learning on a curve
and im certain they couldn't stop
the pace in case you doubted
<|endoftext|>

i taught you greek
but your painting of
was pure platonic form
<|endoftext|>

you drew the masks
of comedy and tragedy
in perfect harmony
<|endoftext|>

of course i love you
but if you love me
marry a young woman
<|endoftext|>

i couldn't stand it
to live with a young
man i being older
<|endoftext|>

it was a coincidence that you were from same college as well
i have watched your dance
each and every moves reflects the dance of goddess
<|endoftext|>

way down south in dixie
they hung my black young lover
to a cross roads tree
<|endoftext|>

way down south in dixie
i asked the white lord jesus
what was the use of prayer
<|endoftext|>

way down south in dixie
love is a naked shadow
on a gnarled and naked tree
<|endoftext|>

oh my god please don't tell me i failed
please lord just give me another chance
i promise i won't let you down
<|endoftext|>

it happened in an instant like a flash of light
a burning deep within me like a shooting star or a crashing flight
like icarus before his demise
<|endoftext|>

a never-ending supply
of food perhaps
asked god
<|endoftext|>

no no
i said
and prayed and prayed
<|endoftext|>

shall i offered god
remove all suffering
from the world
<|endoftext|>

no i said
the world's already used to it
and i prayed and prayed
<|endoftext|>

look you must tell me
what you want
said god now appearing a little irritated
<|endoftext|>

oh well if you insist
i said
i want your job
<|endoftext|>

for only in the gospel will my answers be
through the christ the redeemer my
redemption from this life of multiple lies
<|endoftext|>

how seldom do we talk to god enquire his plan
why waste moments in planning the future
when all to be done is bow our head
<|endoftext|>

yup you're not here for me
and i concede i'll never have
the pieces that you need
<|endoftext|>

before i leave the stage
i will sing the only song
i was meant truly to sing
<|endoftext|>

i live my lie
'cause if the theory's true
love damned can't die
<|endoftext|>

one last package sits lone at midnight sticking up out
of the coast rack high as the dusty fluorescent
light
<|endoftext|>

let my hand touch yours
let me warm it if it's cold
my last warmth shall not be wasted
<|endoftext|>

until finally i discover
they have eliminated all
my pencilled outlines
<|endoftext|>

it's not in the best interest
of a germ like hiv or you
to kill its host
<|endoftext|>

it`s not the end of the road
it`s the beginning of a new highway
the `highway to a destination called `success
<|endoftext|>

i've taken on his features to survive
and from me to the kid spotlights
have furnished only wastelands
<|endoftext|>

these feet have worked farmland
drawing wheat grains from sand grains
and now they walk to the supermarket each week

i remember my incomprehension at the sudden laughter
that burst out like it was planned my heartbeat quickening faster now
i remember i wanted to cry
<|endoftext|>

make this stationary but it is already weighed moresca motion
four cruel columns twisting into beams and arches an epigraph
an old rending red wailing still wailing today an altered chord
<|endoftext|>

i have locked myself in here
why don't i go out there
don't i hold my freedom dear
<|endoftext|>

so i sneak out clandestinely
to make my first move towards my family
but what i see is the absence of love compassion warmth and humility
<|endoftext|>

i found out my way through somehow
and came across a blood-soaked dove
she said this is the worth of peace my love
<|endoftext|>

strangulated i return back to my prison
because i find no reason
to live freely in a world full of treason
<|endoftext|>

on my journey ahead
for more frightening will face me: the thought filled me with dread
though my hunger for knowledge
<|endoftext|>

you give me an apartment full of morning smells toasted bagel and black
coffee and the freckled lilies in the vase on the windowsill
you give me -across
<|endoftext|>

you give me midnight apples in a car with the windows down
you give me the flashbulbs of an electrical storm
you give me thunder and the suddenly green underbellies of clouds
<|endoftext|>

you give me hyacinths and narcissus
you give me foxgloves
and soft fists of peony
<|endoftext|>

farewell
to
- nelson mandela
<|endoftext|>

i wonder whom i should call
a plumber
proctologist urologist or priest
<|endoftext|>

how dare he leave me
lost alone
i cried
<|endoftext|>

a death isn't always
a death it's birth of a new
memory instead
<|endoftext|>

promise made to self
time to began again
a new year's positive change

the colors are great

my love to the end

love will find you
<|endoftext|>

kiss me back to home
if my attempt to escape
makes me a forlorn

life's down side
freezes you in motion
care of self you'll fly again

leaves all gone now
flowers in their bed now
except the every green holding on
<|endoftext|>

green economics
a man dressed in green rides the
bear financial bull
<|endoftext|>

painting the glow
in the green of forest
unseen fingers
<|endoftext|>

snowing
through the blizzard
particles of me
<|endoftext|>

drinking my tea
without sugar
no difference
<|endoftext|>

looking over my shoulder
my behind was covered
with cherry blossoms
<|endoftext|>

i slapped the mosquito
and missed
what made me do that
<|endoftext|>

reading haiku
i am unhappy
longing for the nameless
<|endoftext|>

a frog floating
in the drugstore jar
summer rain on grey pavements
<|endoftext|>

on the porch
in my shorts
auto lights in the rain
<|endoftext|>

another year
has past-the world
is no different
<|endoftext|>

the first thing i looked for
in my old garden was
the cherry tree
<|endoftext|>

my old desk
the first thing i looked for
in my house
<|endoftext|>

my early journal
the first thing i found
in my old desk
<|endoftext|>

my mother's ghost
the first thing i found
in the living room
<|endoftext|>

i quit shaving
but the eyes that glanced at me
remained in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

the madman
emerges from the movies
the street at lunchtime
<|endoftext|>

cities of boys
are in their graves
and in this town
<|endoftext|>

lying on my side
in the void
the breath in my nose
<|endoftext|>

on the fifteenth floor
the dog chews a bone
screech of taxicabs
<|endoftext|>

a hardon in new york
a boy
in san fransisco
<|endoftext|>

the moon over the roof
worms in the garden
i rent this house

rough stone smooth stone - both
born from the same mountain - but
one has suffered much

ere swallows dare come
march's ranging breezes stir
dancing daffodils

bus in motion-and
the passengers suddenly
sing oh canada
<|endoftext|>

hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids
do you grieve their loss
have you thought twice about your braids
<|endoftext|>

are you warrior-pretend
are you horseback-never
was your drum-less drum-less life disguised by your braids
<|endoftext|>

did you cut your hair after your sister's funeral
was it self-flagellation
did you chastise your braids
<|endoftext|>

hey indian boy why did you slice off your braids
was it a violent act
did you despise your braids
<|endoftext|>

and salma's mother takes me behind the house
and there behind the trees she shows me salma's grave
and there on the grave is my jacket
<|endoftext|>

i would buy it beg it steal it
pay in coins of dripping blood
for this one transcendent good
<|endoftext|>

i sit taller
daring to stare back into slate blue eyes
that see only color and shapes
<|endoftext|>

angrily i shout at the anger that is all around
bred in anger
kicking and screaming to hell we seem bound
<|endoftext|>

my soul lashes out at all the meanness
bred in soullessness
few care who they hurt reason for sadness
<|endoftext|>

the victums they collect are all painted with giggs
they have tears on their cheeks
they have red and yellow feet that makes my heart stop it's beat
<|endoftext|>

to say dive deep
into the square event
hunter green and moss
<|endoftext|>

next i expect to hear
the queen is dead
the king's been checked
<|endoftext|>

in their green and yellow dress
home they came in white body bags
in heavy coffins with name tags

but many resented the pogrom
people watched in horror
the roundup they cried silently behind their curtains

the people braced for the answer nothing the atheist said after a pause
he was ecstatic
the people were more than a little disheartened

they started to push and shove

she's gathered up all the time in the world
-nothing else-and waits for scanty trophies
complete in herself as a heron

as his one eye sees nothing not
even the oddly stained floor
i wonder if he thinks

otherwise
through the void

all night she ploughed her solitary way
beneath the stars and through a tranquil sea

cortina rota
leones bailando mambo

<|endoftext|>

radiant highways whose vistas gleam
leading me on under crimson leaves
to the opaline gates of the castles of dream
<|endoftext|>

lazy saturday mornings with nothing to do
breakfast in pajamas
classic cartoons play on the tube
<|endoftext|>

freshly baked bread wafts in the air
eggs and bacon as well
all enjoy it best ever they all declare
<|endoftext|>

nice fresh fruit ripe and sweet
so many to choose
nature's goodness their nectar a treat
<|endoftext|>

jelly beans marshmallows and lots of sweets
chocolate covered as well
so many good things so many tasty treats

kids eating cotton candy with balloons tied to strings
red blue white yellow and green
released all at once a spectacle in the sky it brings

dolphins swimming and jumping in the sea
from the park they can be seen
look at them jump children claim with such glee
<|endoftext|>

kids swimming and jumping in the park pool
playing marco polo
everyone has so much fun everyone keeps cool
<|endoftext|>

all are sharing lots of giving going around
no tempers or angry shouts
laughter fills the air tis the only sound
<|endoftext|>

amusement parks rides are plenty
no lines there are
happy people they are everyone so friendly
<|endoftext|>

sleeping children on their daddies' shoulders
too much fun they have had
some safely asleep tucked away in their baby strollers
<|endoftext|>

for me you don't have any space
remembering your innocent kisses
i want one kiss on my wrinkled face
<|endoftext|>

underneath surface
blood drenched redeemably gold-sparkle
dusted
<|endoftext|>

i come home
after a hard day's work
and my house opens its doors to me
<|endoftext|>

the stove makes me a cup of tea
while the answering machine
tells me all about its day

my windows close their eyes
the cd player begins a serenade
and my curtains invite me to dance

for everything to last long it has to be well maintained

someone is trying to make music somewhere
with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum
with cello boom box harmonica voice
<|endoftext|>

we encounter each other in words words
spiny or smooth whispered or declaimed
words to consider reconsider
<|endoftext|>

we cross dirt roads and highways that mark
the will of some one and then others who said
i need to see what's on the other side
<|endoftext|>

i know there's something better down the road
we need to find a place where we are safe
we walk into that which we cannot yet see

praise song for struggle praise song for the day

love beyond marital filial national
love that casts a widening pool of light
love with no need to pre-empt grievance

i know not where
i know not when
but i have decided to live life till then

i lost my mother more than two decades ago
today on her birthday i spontaneously composed this poem
it's not just for my parents its for all those who love someone dearly
<|endoftext|>

a broken leaf can linger in a limbo
if these non-livings can change the mighty morsels
then why don't we
<|endoftext|>

hope is the life we breathe tomorrow
and the paths we tread every year
hope is the inflation of our ballooned hearts
<|endoftext|>

it's lunch time on a busy work day
and i'm at the happy burger shack
waiting to place my order to go
<|endoftext|>

comes a black man scarecrow thin
his jeans slung lowdown and dirty
an acre of underwear in evidence
<|endoftext|>

thug
he flops down in the first shade available
and sets his lunch sack on the curbside
<|endoftext|>

espiritu santo
then smiles and wishes me blessings
as i drive away with my order
<|endoftext|>

why
why
why must i ask why

they back away from the bear
the bear stirs and shakes off the dream
but the dream won't shake
<|endoftext|>

as i lie in my bed
the flute-notes push against my ears and lips
and i go to sleep dreaming
<|endoftext|>

chairs are really parallel bars
for gymnastics leading to stars
galaxies at the dreamy carpet's edge
<|endoftext|>

i was aware my room was lived-in
my cigarette wasting in an arc of ash i rescued
my opened book advanced a page or two
<|endoftext|>

yet he seems to be saying
how free i am
mocking my ways as sham
<|endoftext|>

i prepare for gritty
crisp and gushious
bursts of pear
<|endoftext|>

don't feel sorry for me
i am a competent
satisfied human being
<|endoftext|>

and thus did i save the earth
though i wish at least those aliens
had left me some presents for my trouble
<|endoftext|>

means a little bit more
and what happened then
well

oh well let's go on eating the grains of eternity
what do we care about improvements in travel
angels sometimes cross the river on old turtles
<|endoftext|>

shall we worry about who gets left behind
that one bird flying through the clouds is enough
your sweet face at the door of the house is enough
<|endoftext|>

the two farm horses stubbornly pull the wagon
the mad crows carry away the tablecloth
most of the time we live through the night
<|endoftext|>

let's not drive the wild angels from our door
maybe the mad fields of grain will move
maybe the troubled rocks will learn to walk
<|endoftext|>

it's all right if we're troubled by the night
it's all right if we can't recall our own name
it's all right if this rough music keeps on playing
<|endoftext|>

i've given up worrying about men living alone
i do worry about the couple who live next door
some words heard through the screen door are enough
<|endoftext|>

i begin to undertake punishment and years of sorrow
if tomorrow isn't enough to borrow any troubles
a character of it's own would be worthed to be worth
<|endoftext|>

omg
like a bulb start burning on the ground of the sleeping cold night looking to see the reason of its immediate distressed
there i go and saw a little one from the corner of my eye changing its color becoming fire on sight
<|endoftext|>

oh how can i not move even my spine dug on comfortable piece calling out my name with unacquainted yell
here i come here i come the respond of my soul
like a prodigal father rushing towards his prodigal son
<|endoftext|>

under the wind's muzzle
and the chant of mermaids
i become one with the eroded sand
<|endoftext|>

your words shatter realities
your existence illuminates life
your meaning deepens the soul

what portion in the world can the artist have
who has awakened from the common dream
but dissipation and despair
<|endoftext|>

so we lock and learn of human migrations of america before columbus and of siberian petroglyphs
we ponder the musings of percy walker and the art of john boatwright
we tune in to listen to strains from mozart and beethoven and we audit short courses about the italian renaissance and southern reconstruction
<|endoftext|>

how robotic i have become
guided by the devils instinct
i am not me

if good heath wishes yet inspire us
hopefully your computer will

round snow flakes
others large small or angled
together they make a snowman

the weeds about him but the land-winds blow

i consult to the doctor
but still
no cure
<|endoftext|>

there is no sin but sloth
burn
to a wick and keep moving
<|endoftext|>

turn your back to fear
her beauty dissolved
to a whisper
<|endoftext|>

music ignites my soul with fire
when i'm in sorrow and in pain
it makes me fall in love again
<|endoftext|>

music is my life after all these years
through ups and downs
somehow i manage to survive in life
<|endoftext|>

though life is a rough road
music makes me dance and sing aloud
through hardships in life
<|endoftext|>

show me purity
i bow to clarity
but what is clear
<|endoftext|>

keep going for we know not others with better honesty
living with cogitate morality you are content and at ease
you aspire for tranquil world hoping this chaos to cease
<|endoftext|>

doing your devoted prophetic work to the good of humanity
your propitious thoughts will frame the system with prosperity
i hence wish this may your good tribes ever increase
<|endoftext|>

in that place called tomorrow
even their distant seeds that dare
shall whisper those names in fear
<|endoftext|>

in that place call tomorrow
families shall gather together again
to eat breakfast and/or dinner
<|endoftext|>

philip said if so i will good tribute pay
the bard compared me to a summer's day
told me work on lovely spenser's art
<|endoftext|>

one day i will
create a master piece
to the liking of one and all
<|endoftext|>

now is here
nothing there
before is gone it wasn't there

there is no such thing as luck only inspiration
there is no such thing as success only will power
remember these lines and you'll build a nation
<|endoftext|>

there is no such thing as happiness only realization
very few might believe what you say but say you must
there is no such thing as luck only inspiration
<|endoftext|>

people may doubt people may question but you must mention
there is no such thing as fate only good performance and bad performance
remember these lines and you'll build a nation
<|endoftext|>

there is nothing that god cannot do
he is in everyone's heart and in each person's aspiration
there is no such thing as luck only inspiration
<|endoftext|>

there is no prayer that god hasn't fulfilled
so shed your doubts fears and inhibition
remember these lines and you'll build a nation
<|endoftext|>

for all its charms the island is uninhabited
and the faint footprints scattered on its beaches
turn without exception to the sea

so honest saint jerry
corrected the holy bible
and said the dog came back too
<|endoftext|>

and brings my memory to your heart
when someday that rare blossom
you find
<|endoftext|>

i sit in the garden
on a small marble bench
beneath the sun
<|endoftext|>

the water glows and makes music
as it falls down the stream
of little waterfalls
<|endoftext|>

i follow the stream
into a land of beauty
and wonder
<|endoftext|>

i walk around to see wild flowers
patches of four leaf clovers
and small rainbows
<|endoftext|>

up and up the flames crawled high
up into the clear green sky
thus toppled the tower with a glorious cry
<|endoftext|>

handshakes unravel chains
jingling child-widower tears as
unsolved bodies lay buried
<|endoftext|>

and a captain announces safe passage
mark
twain
<|endoftext|>

at least in that context
be the pure and fair
to prove
<|endoftext|>

he'll not beg
he'll just walk
he won't even talk
<|endoftext|>

and friends in high places
have no use whatsoever
when they are not your friends
<|endoftext|>

i know a thing that's most uncommon
i know a reasonable woman
handsome and witty yet a friend
<|endoftext|>

for this home to grow old as i do
without fear of future
or penitence for past
<|endoftext|>

you ask yourself
is this some kind of esp
a trick from above
<|endoftext|>

the past
the present
and the future
<|endoftext|>

the path of the just is like the sun
that fades into the sun set
at the end of the day
<|endoftext|>

some things we may never understand
so for now let's not laugh
at the joke of that teen sitting not too far
<|endoftext|>

i always said one day they would use the law of averages to turn us into slaves
and as per usual it's not an easy thing to follow his argument protracted as it is from a slab of research as thick as any thesis
but i kind of listen like i believe him as foolish as it sounds
<|endoftext|>

no one is perfect she knows
why she did so
who know
<|endoftext|>

she was his paradise
now lost
he now bewildering to hide
<|endoftext|>

he was a refugee
wanted a refuge
he knew she would refuse
<|endoftext|>

what he could do
she had eyes anyone could drown in
he was homo too
<|endoftext|>

it was not her fault
both knows
ignorance might be the way
<|endoftext|>

oh take me death
indulge desir'd repose
and draw thy silent curtain round my woes
<|endoftext|>

many eyes cried
but hearts missed him none
alas the conqueror of the world was forever alone
<|endoftext|>

and then solidify
bring down all ever after the stars and make a necklace for my mother
repeat the same mistake each time
<|endoftext|>

shut her lips nbsp my forgetfulness
with your memory words
then shut me
<|endoftext|>

dusted feet and flake embers
as windblown the water oak
next to the winged spindle tree
<|endoftext|>

today thee is melancholy standing on a pulpit
staring at the back of thou arts bride
eluding away with the wind
<|endoftext|>

both of us paper tigers
among the horses
the quadriga shifting shades

some day your life is ending up in thirty-gallon bags
on the street and the rest of it will be shipped
in boxes to people who think it's overdue
<|endoftext|>

think of stone faces of stoics laughing in museums
hold that thought when they pull the plug
and you flatline to your debriefing
<|endoftext|>

i figure for sixty bags and thirty boxes
and hanging around just long enough
to make sure nobody's jumping up and down
<|endoftext|>

you won't be looking for me when you come back
shared blood having always made us invisible to each other
so when i hear you laugh that will suffice to make us free
<|endoftext|>

winning can never get you to anything you will just be nobody you'll never be able to continue your future with just winning because winning isn't everything you can't just win countless times
if you lose it's just a part of your life it normal losing is something that makes your temper out of control like: mad sad and even stress
but we all have to remember that it's just a game it's not a game between being alive or dead so don't worry you have a future for you to move on and never let winning in your way
<|endoftext|>

let me play the strains
of those cadenced memories
and lost orchestrated dreams
<|endoftext|>

strains that ebb and flow
from my blue rustic aged
viola of loneliness
<|endoftext|>

the pleasing smile on an angel's lips
such a captivating sight
made for an eternal gift to my eyes
<|endoftext|>

on the threshold the pain stumbles over despair
and in the bedroom guarding memories curled tightly
a ginger cat gloomily meows
<|endoftext|>

get on your bark sail to the distant pole
in walls of ice - and bit by bit forget
how they loved there perished fought gained goal
<|endoftext|>

you are a mute witness
to this volley of bloodshed
know not how long
<|endoftext|>

she speaks of willows grown aslant a brook
that drape the early tanagers
and house the thrush
<|endoftext|>

nbsp
now the shadow trees are falling autumn
a wanderlust of corals fill up with rocks
<|endoftext|>

my perplexity to know
how much away
from
<|endoftext|>

finding a clear and present purpose
it's the hardest part to escape from the lucid dream
this fake reality that we call life without purpose
<|endoftext|>

a caring heart
a smile a wave a wink
a moment that makes you stop and think
<|endoftext|>

you're not alone even though it seems no one cares
lonely and surrounded by blank looks and empty stares
but there is someone out there someone who deeply cares
<|endoftext|>

like searching for a diamond evasive it seems
impossible to find even in your wildest dreams
but find it you will ending your heart's longing pleas
<|endoftext|>

as you search for the diamond through endless grains of sands
a battered heart on swollen knees and bruised hands
you'll find the one that one buried in the deepest of sands
<|endoftext|>

the search may be painful tedious and dark
trouble maybe all that you find from the moment you start
but you will find that diamond and it will be dear to your heart
<|endoftext|>

a caring heart
a smile a wave a wink
that moment will come and your hearts will sync
<|endoftext|>

when i shall have given you the last one
you will have the whole of me
but i shall be dead
<|endoftext|>

never together never apart stands a love awaiting a heart
a heart apart from a love a far together hearts loves always apart
love apart from a heart stands a heart a waiting
<|endoftext|>

is there a way
<|endoftext|>

in my heart in my head there is a place for you
and all the things i said i spoke the truth
i'll remember you
<|endoftext|>

because doll you did something to me
you gave me eyes amp now i can see
everything
<|endoftext|>

years have passed and i stand where we once laid
an as i look around everything's the same
except one thing
<|endoftext|>

so i sit down on the ground lay back and rest my eyes
and as i drift into slumber our past comes alive
under the same starry sky
<|endoftext|>

beloved beloved
just as ordinary  just as dull
just as written
<|endoftext|>

let molon and none else that ordeal brave
while we make ease our study and secure
some witch to charm all evil from our door
<|endoftext|>

beside whose cornstacks may i oft again
plant my broad fan: while she stands by and smiles
poppies and cornsheaves on each laden arm
<|endoftext|>

the first time
i dreamed the major thirteen
i was just over sixty
<|endoftext|>

not thick brown rice and rice pilaw
or mushrooms creamed on toast
turnips mashed and parsnips hashed
<|endoftext|>

health-food folks around the world
are thinned by anxious zeal
they look for help in seafood kelp
<|endoftext|>

the world won't last
what are you
what am i
<|endoftext|>

search it out and refresh thee
he will make thee wise and thou wilt find freedom
for thou art a captive and the world is a prison
<|endoftext|>

into beautiful madness like a bridge between
all things near and far her heart a collectible
a piece of vintage art

angel's seven years memory
author's note: a poem for a treasured not a trashed memory for my ex girlfriend whom i spent my life with for seven years

we the great gazebo built
they convicted us of guilt
bid me strike a match and blow
<|endoftext|>

i use my soul
as a paper weight
to hold the mountains in place
<|endoftext|>

we knew
we would not know them much
or more to know them much no more
<|endoftext|>

pray i will and sing i must
and yet i weep  oedipus' child

you are waiting like the bride on the abandoned bed
dreaming of him with open arms as he brings a sack full of dreams
extending your hands with softness as in the beloved hair
<|endoftext|>

relaxing there
and beging for your dream intertwined in your long fingers
and while wiping your forehead you understand that godo arrived and your wait remained an endless wait
<|endoftext|>

close your doors
i am the guardian
nothing belongs to you
<|endoftext|>

i stand tall and am a dad
as lively i fly in sky
along with my little sanson-lad
<|endoftext|>

as i pull over to a stop
seeing a twenty tun tractor coming towards me
all i think is there goes my mirror
<|endoftext|>

o poor moon
you're just about your own radiant business
and all these freaks put it at your doorstep
<|endoftext|>

i declare this tower is my symbol i declare
this winding gyring spiring treadmill of a stair is my ancestral stair
that goldsmith and the dean berkeley and burke have travelled there

dispelling the notion
of an earth at rest

incredulous at his own audacity
copernicus repeatedly wipes his brow
and furiously paces his study
<|endoftext|>

finding his own place in space
copernicus awaits his death
a rigid motion transformation

everything is alive so that i can be alive
without moving i can see it all

the praise of such generosity

until the sea-bathe at noon
<|endoftext|>

we see the longer shadows of the sun

elated is your face
placid is thou mind
perhaps in me - the reason you'll find
<|endoftext|>

when your heart trumpets with pride
and the highest achiever is shy
perhaps in me - the reason may lie
<|endoftext|>

when your head is held high
and the biggest malady at cure
perhaps in me - humanity is pure
<|endoftext|>

when your fictional dreams come true
and all your fancies is the reality before you
perhaps the reason is all that i aspire to do
<|endoftext|>

when your expressions exhibit glory
and your brow speaks that out
perhaps the reason is me - my toiling bout
<|endoftext|>

when you feel to love
and you intend for life
perhaps the reason is me - i have appeased your strife
<|endoftext|>

a good broadening smile
filled with the joys of spring
perhaps the reason is me - the little i could bring
<|endoftext|>

when your eyes appreciate
and your hands urge to bless
perhaps its me - i am the praise
<|endoftext|>

when i feel blessed with a divine touch
a heavenly halo surrounding me
perhaps you mom is the reason of what i can be

someone always told me this with tears in her eyes
a wife left south africa in the 's to join her husband
who was in exile at the time
<|endoftext|>

too much tumor there they'd said blandly
so in the end that's how she had lain on the pyre
and breathed in our hearts
<|endoftext|>

most hurt on our neglect
but never neglect us
as nothing precious to her than us
<|endoftext|>

when the branch fell off the tree it made an almighty noise
says mum
so we went downstairs to investigate
<|endoftext|>

child the house is lonely
i feel alien in native acreage
come dear come back to womb

she knew this would lead to repentance
cakes she baked little stories she faked
but every night she lay awake
<|endoftext|>

a harmony writ in her mind
an insecure feeling
that she might lose all her right
<|endoftext|>

my mother believed it was okay admirable
even to have friends who were not white
but that you wouldn't want to marry them
<|endoftext|>

and if you did then you shouldn't have children
with them because then your children
would be discriminated against
<|endoftext|>

as if it would be a mistake to have our
children be darker when we spent
all this time becoming white
<|endoftext|>

it was okay with her in a way when my
daughter was born because she looked
like she could be white
<|endoftext|>

since he hid in his cloths
bunches of mint and thyme

notes
komori is a generic term that consists of a noun ko  and a verb moru  japanese use it to refer to any person male or female old or young who takes care of children
like their european counterparts nursemaids and nannies komori began to appear in what michel foucault has called the discourse of power in the late nineteenth century

this vine bore many blossoms which were years
their petals red with joy or bleached by tears
waved to and fro i' the winds of hopes and fears
<|endoftext|>

here all men clung each hanging by his spray
anon one dropped his neighbor 'gan to pray
and so they clung and dropped and prayed alway
<|endoftext|>

but i did mark one lately-opened bloom
wherefrom arose a visible perfume
that wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom
<|endoftext|>

may all that cling to sprays of time like me
be sweetly wafted over sky and sea
by rose-breaths shrining maidens like to thee
<|endoftext|>

then while we sat upon the height afar
came twilight like a lover late from war
with soft winds fluting to his evening star
<|endoftext|>

and the shy stars grew bold and scattered gold
and chanting voices ancient secrets told
and an acclaim of angels earthward rolled
<|endoftext|>

i know whose prayers would make me whole

i ascended from the brine to the sight of splendid willows
all prosaic things became sanctified

how past thought returning sweet

<|endoftext|>

on new year's day
i long to meet my parents
as they were before my birth
<|endoftext|>

the room is full of shadow you can hear indistinctly the sad soft whispering of two children
their foreheads lean forward still heavy with dreams beneath the long white bed-curtain
which shudders and rises
<|endoftext|>

ii
but the little children beneath the swaying curtain talk in low voices as one does on a dark night
thoughtfully they listen as to a far-off murmur
<|endoftext|>

iii
your heart has understood:  these children are motherless
no mother in the place any more
<|endoftext|>

an old servant woman then has taken them under her care
the little ones are alone in the icy house four-year-old orphans see how in their thoughts
little by little a smiling memory awakes
<|endoftext|>

the earth half-bare happy to be alive again trembles with joy beneath the sun's kisses
in the old home all is warm and flushed: no longer are there mourning garments strewn on the floor
and the draught has at least ceased to moan under the door
<|endoftext|>

it is two silvery plaques black and white
glittering with mother-of-pearl and jet little black frames and wreaths of glass
with three words engraved in gold: 'to our mother
<|endoftext|>

i write fiend for friend
and word for world

from my invisible havens

when another day is dawning

oh the shadows intertwined
oh the corporeal shadows united with the shadows of the souls
oh the seeking shadows in those nights of sorrows and of tears

a strange restlessness

how can thy be so self-righteous and stick to one thing

how can i be so self-centered and so ambiguous

don't place your trust in me for i am ambiguous

you mutilate my love

when they say i have come
i have not till the people
you see rise and embrace me

you will not need to be told
how sweet i can be
<|endoftext|>

you will show it
in your own smiling fields
pregnant with crop and honey money
<|endoftext|>

like brothers the nations and religions
should walk hand in hand
for world peace and growth
<|endoftext|>

were they here as friend or foe
left me wondering

let the nation deluge with amity
and drive out the hostility
fabricate and bind unity among us

to be inside one to hold
the other
<|endoftext|>

to check if your checkpoints were more than just rumour
to see if the claims of the chains were just heightened
to see if the blindfolds on free thoughts were tightened
<|endoftext|>

tales of abduction and bumps in the night
actions that spoke of a want to spread fright
lives plucked into thinness to prove who is right
<|endoftext|>

the odour of blood spilled from the back
the stench of aged fear curdling inside
the acrid burn of wildfire eating your pride

and with a stiffened hold of an awkward embrace
i came back to hug you and found you disgraced
<|endoftext|>

consumerism's got the best of me in spite of my fighting so hard to maintain the good thinks in life
i keep fighting a losing battle
i want to believe the best things in life are free but i get stopped in my tracks

in which evil torments and exploits
as much of creation as it can reach

meanwhile a politician stands on a street corner sermonizing
as all these stray children go running home starving to death

but not that selfsame excellence again

<|endoftext|>

what will suffice for a true-love knot
even the rain
but he has bought grief's lottery bought even the rain
<|endoftext|>

our glosses / wanting in this world can you remember
anyone
when we thought / the poets taught even the rain
<|endoftext|>

after we died that was it
god left us in the dark
and as we forgot the dark we forgot even the rain
<|endoftext|>

i turn on the gas
flare like the many
blue incandescent flames
<|endoftext|>

maize maize
it was after our chickens
have had their fill
<|endoftext|>

here we are with love pouring out of every orifice
here they are dancing
around the funeral pyre the corpse in absentia
<|endoftext|>

in the morning elephant grass moves the way
mist is visible in the breeze but doesn
t dampen the skin
<|endoftext|>

i have ants in my leg
and my leg went to sleep
are not the same thing
<|endoftext|>

no more running long or short distance
the old women
snicker at me when i pass them by
<|endoftext|>

the sea
s like the desert
neither quenches the thirst
<|endoftext|>

here i ride my bicycle invisible
except for a crescent shadow and the milky way
is already past
<|endoftext|>

the pages of my notebook soak then curl
i've written
yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain
<|endoftext|>

i hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me
the night collapses into your skin
i am the rain
<|endoftext|>

i am not trying to say anything
i'll say
i am just telling you what happened
<|endoftext|>

what's the point of that
they'll say
it isn't interesting
<|endoftext|>

(or maybe i won't
i am always anticipating conversations
and often people say completely different things
<|endoftext|>

in between your thighs
nbsp i'm sure you weren't ready for what was in store so you settle for a side
nbsp yet your my minds appetite throughout the night
<|endoftext|>

oh
i said angry and afraid
and i threw down my books
<|endoftext|>

ever since you provided
your summary of the kama sutra
delivered in such melodramatic actor's voice
<|endoftext|>

now maybe it'd do you good
to repeat the mantra times
and go to sleep
<|endoftext|>

he discovers all these books
at the national library
and bookshops
<|endoftext|>

and off they went
outraged father and trembling son
into dusty history
<|endoftext|>

i know where you are you are uptown in a seedy bar
you're covering your ears so blood won't spill because you swear you just heard someone insult the man you love
but i'm still blue and i'm still downtown and i don't know that you love me
<|endoftext|>

to god i said again
but my faith
god showed no sign of assurance
<|endoftext|>

what now
sighed god
quite irritated
<|endoftext|>

daddy daddy
where's mummy
asked adam
<|endoftext|>

the expert in magic confirmed it was white magic and shared the spells with everyone
the spells brought wonder and joy to the people in the land of the lost
and perhaps that is magic in itself
<|endoftext|>

nor am i inherent in the vedas
nor am i present in intoxicants
nor am i lost nor the corrupt
<|endoftext|>

nor am i union nor grief
nor am i intrinsic in the pure/impure
nor am i of water nor of land
<|endoftext|>

nor did i create differences of faith
nor did i create adam and eve
nor did i name my self
<|endoftext|>

beginning or end i just know the self
do not acknowledge duality
there's none wise than i
<|endoftext|>

who is this bulla shah
bulla
i know not who i am
<|endoftext|>

ho
let's take it slow
she said how do you know your master knows
<|endoftext|>

she jumped from the back to front of her mind as she struggled to severe the lie that would bind her to him the lie of his lambs or his god or his temple or dark holy flag
or the great golden rod which he held into place as he stride on the world with the waste that he made for the people he graced
with his pomp and pretend and his bendable laws she considered his dreams and counted his flaws
<|endoftext|>

oh said adam
but you created me
so why can't i call you daddy
<|endoftext|>

no
thundered mighty god
and that is that
<|endoftext|>

through my prayers streams
the moon the refracted
light of the sun
<|endoftext|>

i worship my father
my brother and friend
by his side until the end
<|endoftext|>

both: man and satan are the fuel of falsehood
but the ingredient that tell between them
is of stupendous quite contradictory opposing
<|endoftext|>

you don't understand
you could have been anybody
the girl in my science class who laughs too loud at my funnys and look so much like  you
<|endoftext|>

anybody
you could have been that girl i kissed behind the backstop
her hair mixed in the tall natural hue much more interesting then her lips
<|endoftext|>

i know for certain when i see the first bloody tear forming that your agony this time will be worth preserving
as they part the watchers come down from the towers
that first great sob could have killed me
<|endoftext|>

the animal within just wants to pounce and devour you
i know how you will taste closer to the truth than the pious blood of christ
i have seen the evidence in textbooks researched the rumours heard in hotel lobbys and religious gatherings
<|endoftext|>

i follow you among the famine tents of faith and as i observe you kneeling i begin to believe that the distance between us is imagined and false
chasing you the sleep thinker you who has seen things said to be concealed is no easy task
weaving roses in the waveform as you wander wayward leaves even athletes short of breath and that dance only you can do leaves others with broken toes
<|endoftext|>

guys do mean it when they say i love you
for creatures are we of ambition and clay
affection desire worry and play
<|endoftext|>

envelops mute appreciations
for all you've encountered were the whole story told
all the trials and the tribulations
<|endoftext|>

a howling hurt
this is not a treasury
where gold is stored this is for copper
<|endoftext|>

a call after the separation
is like digging up the buried corpse and
asking did you die
<|endoftext|>

you are the flower i always wanted
and i am the mismatch of your life
now trying to understand what happened
<|endoftext|>

why did you let me feast on your nectar
sleep on your petals
and become so spoiled
<|endoftext|>

and why i could not see that you had stopped dreaming of me
fighting for me believing in me
and wanting me
<|endoftext|>

what happened has now become another puzzle of love
one where different worlds coexist happily
until their hearts can not longer be warmed by the same flame
<|endoftext|>

while wax dripped
slowly crashing down
i melted from your life
<|endoftext|>

days past long ago when she walked with me
when i could reach deep into her soul and see her
seeing her as she use to be
<|endoftext|>

just her and me
those days are gone my time with her is past
she gave me a whole lifetime
<|endoftext|>

i treasure her memories forever
alzheimers will never take those away from me
those day are gone my time with her is past
<|endoftext|>

no longer lost and wandering
i'll find a star to guide me
i'm moving on
<|endoftext|>

do i disappoint you
perhaps because of my words
or maybe it's the lack of it
<|endoftext|>

do i disappoint you
by what i did or do
or perhaps what i didn't
<|endoftext|>

am i the one you want me to be
am i your type of guy
or perhaps the stand by
<|endoftext|>

do i disappoint you
or do i disappoint me
am i a prisoner begging to be free
<|endoftext|>

was i a prisoner of my own emotions
was my love so insignificant to you
as a single grain or a drop in the ocean
<|endoftext|>

do i disappoint you when you look in my eyes
and when i look in yours
i only see unspoken love and closed doors
<|endoftext|>

'an open rebuke is better than hidden love
rebuke me now rebuke me now if you may
before i walk away from my love of yesterday
<|endoftext|>

if reason has its reasons
the world is just well
the way it is
<|endoftext|>

god is not dead
god is alive and well
and living as a parasite inside the brains of unsuspecting hosts

it might help you heal to talk
about your childhood travails sir
rather than use this form of torture on youth and so perpetuate this
<|endoftext|>

put on your shoes
get your car keys
and let's go
<|endoftext|>

they dull my eyes yet
i keep on dying
because i love to live
<|endoftext|>

number  someone who can be
original in dress
stylish
<|endoftext|>

hues of turquoise green and blue
dashed against the sky
in silky wonder
<|endoftext|>

you watch it move
react
in a moment everything can be won or lost
<|endoftext|>

but you're flying
floating on a carpet of glass
you wish the moment would never end
<|endoftext|>

this is the beginning
thank you me blossom winning
for this year end
<|endoftext|>

the crayoned rainbow
got swallowed by her sea bed
sinking deep inside
<|endoftext|>

on a stone bench
mother fingers her wrinkles
autumn loneliness
<|endoftext|>

to his arab followers and to his wives
the fruit was three skies above luxury
and as indispensable as water and air
<|endoftext|>

and push through sodden earth just sewn
says the gently helping rain
taking april captive
<|endoftext|>

soak slowly through my mudden shroud
says the dormant colour waiting to
besiege may
<|endoftext|>

wirey arms will find strong hands
then on their well-splayed heads and hairs
invaders land
<|endoftext|>

will someone finally
check on me
only to find that i'm finally free
<|endoftext|>

the euphony of the rustling
meadow was my education
among flowers i learned to love
<|endoftext|>

you become aware
how should i say
i love you
<|endoftext|>

they say it's for a short term
and i have to be firm
but the term isn't short
<|endoftext|>

i feel used he said
and old as usual
i believe i'm at the height of my existence
<|endoftext|>

my sister is a beautiful girl
but she don't want to be miss world
her personality cannot be rewarded by no judge or earl
<|endoftext|>

to waste and paraffin
pistons gone tired of out-and-in
hard work as black and dull as sin
<|endoftext|>

and each spoonful
stopped a moment in midair in its withering
steam
<|endoftext|>

in the night of weariness
let me give myself up to sleep without struggle
resting my trust upon thee
<|endoftext|>

'i think that i shall find her
in a young man's bed
the colonel went out sailing
<|endoftext|>

the nursery fire burns brightly and flings fan-bursts of stars up
the chimney
as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars
<|endoftext|>

gone
gone
gone
<|endoftext|>

they say: we were young
we have died
remember us
<|endoftext|>

they say: whether our lives and our deaths were for
peace and a new hope or for nothing we cannot say
it is you who must say this
<|endoftext|>

i am struck by visions beside the lane
on starry october nights laved by the autumn rain
and i sleep beneath the myrtles musing on her kiss
<|endoftext|>

man and woman they felled mountains and gardens
then went down to the river they scaled the walls
they hoisted their atrocious artillery up the hill
<|endoftext|>

then love knew it was called love
and when i lifted my eyes to your name
suddenly your heart showed me my way
<|endoftext|>

naiad: cut your body into turquoise pieces
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
this is how you become everything that lives
<|endoftext|>

we have a soul at times
no one's got it non-stop
for keeps
<|endoftext|>

day after day
year after year
may pass without it
<|endoftext|>

it usually steps out
whenever meat needs chopping
or forms have to be filled
<|endoftext|>

we can count on it
when we're sure of nothing
and curious about everything
<|endoftext|>

it won't say where it comes from
or when it's taking off again
though it's clearly expecting such questions
<|endoftext|>

as it's commonly said
an apple a day
keeps the doctor away
<|endoftext|>

zu blitz
lehrer
die verwanderlung - the will of nietzsche
<|endoftext|>

tumbling crushing spinning
in the maddening chaos
of the spiral time
<|endoftext|>

was no more
my soul ripped asunder
the stars
<|endoftext|>

i couldn't sleep
for thinking
emmett till
<|endoftext|>

laying on the bed
praying for a wife
in walk sonji roi
<|endoftext|>

pretty little shape
do you like
chop suey
<|endoftext|>

can i wash your hair
underneath
that wig
<|endoftext|>

the count is full
the stadium is full
one last time for the year
<|endoftext|>

exultant they hover
and shadow the sun with
foreboding
<|endoftext|>

i remember how you bravely fought like a man
against omar narvaez arce and nishioka of japan
i remember how you easily beat them all
<|endoftext|>

we waited
on the street outside
for alf to arrive
<|endoftext|>

the infant hydrocephalus who sat
at a bridge end by a dried-up water-course
and fiddled
<|endoftext|>

you are worth it you are worthless you are worth it you
are worthless
fingernails petals
<|endoftext|>

the shrilling organ an engine failing on an airbus
divers floating victims from plane wrecks
bodies all bloated and the same
<|endoftext|>

the judicious arise and wander
casual through the great halls of the
sacrificial and the sacrificed
<|endoftext|>

but how can the queen learn
miaow
if she never looks at me
<|endoftext|>

his snortings will rise to my head
and i shall be hot and laugh
forgetting that i have ever known a woman
<|endoftext|>

tell the moon to come
for i do not want to see the blood
of ignacio on the sand
<|endoftext|>

let my memory kindle
warm the jasmines
of such minute whiteness
<|endoftext|>

my son sits at the edge of my bed
and asks me to recite a poem
a tear falls from my eyes onto the pillow
<|endoftext|>

my son lays down his pens his crayon box in
front of me
and asks me to draw a homeland for him
<|endoftext|>

it was a chance you grieve
because you know
it was also a choice
<|endoftext|>

talking to a friend
or sending them a text
they talk for hours on end
<|endoftext|>

they'll leave their room a mess
and give cleaning it a miss
but yes i must confess to also doing this
<|endoftext|>

they think their folks are ancient and utterly unfair
the result is to ignore them
before they start to swear
<|endoftext|>

their music cracks the ceiling and makes their parents fume
emotions always reeling
and spend more time in their room
<|endoftext|>

between rendezvous and letter
no eternity passes
only a few days or weeks
<|endoftext|>

i don't owe them anything
love would have said
on this open topic
<|endoftext|>

orators spoke sincere
touche
the light is near
<|endoftext|>

between you and me
tell me or rather
is there a possibility
<|endoftext|>

or plainly ecclesiastical
not to overlook
love underlined
<|endoftext|>

gather your thoughts ma'am
put them away under your hat
where they belong
<|endoftext|>

gather your thoughts ma'am
or you might be the one
who gets locked up
<|endoftext|>

we are children of the almighty
so we are inborn prince or princes
we are not beggar
<|endoftext|>

mum not understanding
papa still musing
plans keep failing do not think suicide
<|endoftext|>

life is a beauty life is a challenge
accept it my dear do not break your family's heart
but go ahead live life full never think of suicide
<|endoftext|>

just a few minutes we have shared
on the same trail
for i am just passing through
<|endoftext|>

can't i go back
wait a minute
i mean
<|endoftext|>

no comments clever no boasting wit
just warm arms outreaching
saying take my hand and sit
<|endoftext|>

a beatific smile escapes my lips
conquering all my doubts
and in ecstasy i live knowing
<|endoftext|>

i'm the painter of my world
mystery is a facade of fun
tribulation a conscious cloak
<|endoftext|>

unseen unbounded fathomless fantasies
are i weaving in all planes
master of play and ploy
<|endoftext|>

once a blossoming bud then dying dirt
as a nagging wife and blushing bride
in all i pervade and prevail
<|endoftext|>

i give you all my life
and a gift of love
filled with happiness and peace
<|endoftext|>

'come all to church good people
oh noisy bells be dumb
i hear you i will come
<|endoftext|>

the first risen
are now first likely to fall
dead in the street
<|endoftext|>

the day was great
and the sun was burning
slowly night fell
<|endoftext|>

what happened next
how do i tell
i think i was lost and
<|endoftext|>

what we want to tell him
he hears well enough but muffles with a cough
and waves aside
<|endoftext|>

since our lights were extinguished
i have been searching for a way to see
my eyes are lost god knows where
<|endoftext|>

be patient a flash of lightning will come
from another horizon like the white hand
of moses with my eyes my lost diamonds
<|endoftext|>

two decades and a half of marriage
it does not really seem as long
of youth's ebullient song
<|endoftext|>

stars trip down into
the air to enjoy
the sweet bliss
<|endoftext|>

mighty swords go
blunt to make the day
merrier than a tulip's kiss
<|endoftext|>

hope your prince
charming gets a
rocking life abord
<|endoftext|>

where the only sound is greed
and the only clock is light
and pillars of ivory marble glow
<|endoftext|>

your carved grey smile fractures
my curved white hands falter
but tourists don't like tears
<|endoftext|>

he killed his wife at night
he had tried once or twice in the daylight
but she refused to die
<|endoftext|>

in darkness the deed was done
not crudely with a hammer-hard gun
or strangler's black kid gloves on
<|endoftext|>

she just ceased being alive
not there to interfere or connive
linger leave or arrive
<|endoftext|>

it seemed almost as though
her death was quite normal and no
clue to his part would show
<|endoftext|>

and all night all night he enjoyed her
such sport in her smooth dimpled water
then daylight came like a warder
<|endoftext|>

and he rose and went down to the larder
where the mouse-trap again had caught a
piece of stale gorgonzola
<|endoftext|>

i can see the world out yonder
it looks to be
pretty big
<|endoftext|>

not at all what the books say
it's not a movie
there's no script
<|endoftext|>

no one ever thought it would be this way
so whatever we'll be starting today
we better get it started our way
<|endoftext|>

i think i would die out on my own
'cause i don't know what else to do
without you
<|endoftext|>

she must grant us flowing words sleepless
as lovers are and a fuller cup and bolder life and
holy remembrance as well to stay wakeful at night
<|endoftext|>

he looked at me bestowing beauty
and i took it for my own
happy i swallowed a star
<|endoftext|>

eve from a rib venus from sea foam
minerva from the head of jove
were much more real
<|endoftext|>

he lowered his head down to my ear: stalwart lover
are you asleep
he whispered disappointedly
<|endoftext|>

terrified
because i daren't go the way she went
yet
<|endoftext|>

i kneel once more
in case mercy should come
in the nick of time
<|endoftext|>

stupid shifty small and sly
peeping through a slit of sty
squinting through their neighbours' plackets
<|endoftext|>

the zen of life is in your parted lips
o you demonstrate the zen of smoking
and my desires are in the ocean of your clothes
<|endoftext|>

fabulous women who
close your doors still
still soaked in night dream on
<|endoftext|>

what is a woman that you forsake her
and the hearth-fire and the home-acre
to go with the old grey widow-maker
<|endoftext|>

she has no house to lay a guest in
but one chill bed for all to rest in
that the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in
<|endoftext|>

she has no strong white arms to fold you
but the ten-times-fingering weed to hold you
out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you
<|endoftext|>

you forget our mirth and talk at the tables
the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables
to pitch her sides and go over her cables
<|endoftext|>

then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow
and the sound of your oar-blades falling hollow
as all we have left through the months to follow
<|endoftext|>

ah what is woman that you forsake her
and the hearth-fire and the home-acre
to go with the old grey widow maker
<|endoftext|>

at the endless beauty of her brown skin
she should be compared to nature
brown hills mountains fertile valleys dewy grass wind and clear water
<|endoftext|>

indian men are horses smelling wild and gamey
when the indian man
unbuttons his pants the white woman should think of topsoil
<|endoftext|>

there must be one murder one suicide one attempted rape
alcohol should be consumed
cars must be driven at high speeds
<|endoftext|>

and obviously from horse cultures
if the interior indian is male
then he must be a warrior especially if he is inside a white man
<|endoftext|>

if the interior indian is female then she must be a healer especially if she is inside
a white woman
sometimes there are complications
<|endoftext|>

for this we need children
a white child and an indian child gender
not important should express deep affection in a childlike way
<|endoftext|>

somewhere between the sayable and the unsayable poetry runs
antidote to the river
of forgetting
<|endoftext|>

at least i think
because i haven't been there
yet
<|endoftext|>

what if the powers that be
turn up their noses
no good no good
<|endoftext|>

i think
i'll keep writing poems
no one will read
<|endoftext|>

i've been eating
like a sultan
since i was two days old
<|endoftext|>

i had a mother
and three sisters
who worshipped me
<|endoftext|>

set the vision
and start the mission
to set the world into motion
<|endoftext|>

backyard
sweet memories
unbarred
<|endoftext|>

far in the north where the dark-eyed neva river
spills its cold waters and a june day has no end
the city of my childhood sprang up on the marsh
<|endoftext|>

i hear clatter of horses' hooves and see a bronze horseman
traversing each night the broad prospects and vast plazas
with one leap overcoming the chasm under the drawbridge
<|endoftext|>

i pass by elegant french-style houses and gardens
the riches of the age of the tsars added to their brilliance their proud beauty
the old capital of the empire never surrendered never knelt down
<|endoftext|>

nbsp
who knew time would change so many things
life nbsp people things destiny
<|endoftext|>

nbsp
afterwards
we lead lives of our own
<|endoftext|>

so frigil never mobbed by a racket
blazing eyes dreams of soaring heights
little feet wrapped in longing sheets
<|endoftext|>

skin of pearl hair of wonderous curls
a needy face
an innocent grace
<|endoftext|>

a water a psalm
no arrogant steps
just the innocence in every step
<|endoftext|>

what inspired you to [tape damaged
a dog that'd just been neutered
he'd pay a quarter [tape damaged] shakin' wildly like one of them guys with that disease you know ahh
<|endoftext|>

je nous ai interdit
a tout prix
d'exister
<|endoftext|>

who is he who becomes statue like forlorn numbed
on seeing trickling tears in the eyes of motherhood
and feeling the gusts of air changing their direction
<|endoftext|>

the children are at the loom of another world
their braids are oiled and black their dresses bright
their assorted heights would make a melodious chime
<|endoftext|>

they watch their flickering knots like television
as the garden of islam grows the bench will be raised
then they will lace the dark-rose veins of the tree-tops
<|endoftext|>

the carpet will travel in the merchant's truck
it will be spread by the servants of the mosque
deep and soft it will give when heaped with prayer
<|endoftext|>

the children are hard at work in the school of days
from their fingers the colours of all-that-will-be fly
and freeze into the frame of all-that-was
<|endoftext|>

once positioned on their lips
even the scariest of words
come out as a melodious lisp
<|endoftext|>

all day long all through the night
all affairs yours ours theirs
are political affairs
<|endoftext|>

whatever you say reverberates
whatever you don't say speaks for itself
so either way you're talking politics
<|endoftext|>

even when you take to the woods
you're taking political steps
on political grounds
<|endoftext|>

but alas imagine no more for such children exist
children as old as you
children even younger than you
<|endoftext|>

all my gifts under the tree
don't know what to give
i'll give him my heart
<|endoftext|>

good is gifts under the tree
better is good food to eat
best of all a baby savior's birthday
<|endoftext|>

green and red
balls silver and gold
hung on christmas eve
<|endoftext|>

candy to eat
a toy to play with
the joy of a stocking filled
<|endoftext|>

then it stopped retreating into the darkness
as if it wanted
a clear overview of its fate
<|endoftext|>

december o december
let us forget taxes and woes
as we unwrap ribbons and bows
<|endoftext|>

a wreath with a bright red bow
decorations in evey room
bringing christmas cheer to all
<|endoftext|>

twelfth day of christmas
among twelve drummers drumming
was one little boy
<|endoftext|>

bringing folks together
sharing joy and love
hollie is one for the door
<|endoftext|>

happy times return
the winter with its chill
snow mist fog and rain
<|endoftext|>

the trees dress snow-white
spruce fir pine don bells and lights
baubles tinsels star
<|endoftext|>

cantatas and hymns
carols noels and melody
wake up silent night
<|endoftext|>

gift bringer santa
puts on white-red cap and cloak
shoulders a gift sack
<|endoftext|>

he peeks through windows
for socks of dreaming children
to give them surprise
<|endoftext|>

the church bells resound
dulcet choirs kill drowsiness
lights dispel darkness
<|endoftext|>

cakes chocos candies
truffles tarts cookies dumplings
desserts nuts and fruits
<|endoftext|>

turkey chicken duck
sausages ham bacon pie
sizzle on salvers
<|endoftext|>

wine drinks decoctions
soups stews broths mousse and puddings
sweet sour all for you
<|endoftext|>

invite friends and foes
be a visitor yourself
spread love and be loved
<|endoftext|>

rockets of blind faith
sputter and crackle dead dreams
like time bleeding stars
<|endoftext|>

through soft painted moans
a man watches his life drown
in waves of glass bones
<|endoftext|>

celestial winds
blow chilled screams for love's mercy
down canyons of dread
<|endoftext|>

through bright haunted smiles
a woman hums white magic
sings pain into pearls
<|endoftext|>

reflections of self
in multiple dimensions
whirl across the sky
<|endoftext|>

machine guns fire knives
that slice the world's bloody tears
like bits of strange fruit
<|endoftext|>

throbbing blue rhythms
a torn heart wrestles naked
with wounds from the past
<|endoftext|>

black holes coalesce
into mounds of burned feathers
and crucified trust
<|endoftext|>

between death and hell
a bridge shining silver wings
offers his soul hope
<|endoftext|>

that good gardener
who wept thorns plowing his fields
harvests grace with joy
<|endoftext|>

stuff the mailboxes and night repositories
against my attempts to insert
flat evidence of my belonging here
<|endoftext|>

my climate's not suitable for growing
the fruit expected of your tree
and i see you have no patience for experiment
<|endoftext|>

i've misunderstood great men in useful ways
in the natural course of an alien life
so why would i quarrel with locked doors
<|endoftext|>

soft this explosion
from alpha to omega
sizzling our names raw
<|endoftext|>

here is the timeless
mystery that pays no heed
to death's greedy pride
<|endoftext|>

songs of hearts divine
mortal angelic holy
billow starlit wings
<|endoftext|>

here are lips of flame
eager to be extinguished
by love's liquid sigh
<|endoftext|>

addicted to bliss
dark heaven floods the soul
bright with miracles
<|endoftext|>

stars wishing upon
the potential of humans
shine faithfully on
<|endoftext|>

from you i'll ask
but won't expect
that miracle
<|endoftext|>

now go meet your deadline
go gather your wheat
but most of all have fun accomplishing this feat
<|endoftext|>

grows on its own
doesn't require our attention
and it becomes the whole bush of it
<|endoftext|>

- do people understand the speech of flowers
with their stench they marked
one completely innocent being
<|endoftext|>

its scent is really gentle
quite tranquil
and mild
<|endoftext|>

ay but like love
the archers
are blind
<|endoftext|>

feel and pull - see there's the boat and you
and the forces and the ground
and there's much within you
<|endoftext|>

there's the mark of the effort
in your mind as footprints in the sand
pull young one
<|endoftext|>

i get to see
maybe half
of what i'm looking at
<|endoftext|>

colors
i've never seen
before
<|endoftext|>

she bows her head in recognition of their beauty whispering her confusion
willing them to know wanting them near at this time as the night enfolds with the man offering his soft touches and caresses
the tiny gestures she has no memories of
<|endoftext|>

the waning moon a witness to her turmoil
she feels his hand softly tingle down her back she turns to the man finds him smiling intense eyes questioning her solitude
the passion runs through her like the current of the high tide whetting her desire for the closeness of him
<|endoftext|>

she holds out her arms to embrace him her dream becomes reality focussing on his lovely face
she draws the man of pleasures closer drawing all of him to her melting into one moment of eternity
she knows there is only the now of this instant and then there is only solitude with the beauty of him lingering throughout her perfection
<|endoftext|>

she
and must no beautiful woman be
learned like a man
<|endoftext|>

she
i have heard said
there is great danger in the body
<|endoftext|>

he
did god in portioning wine and bread
give man his thought or his mere body
<|endoftext|>

i danced and the stars moved with me
the ground lept beneath my bare feet
i was exalted by the silvery moonlight  and the air was crisp cool and sweet
<|endoftext|>

one night i sat beauty down on my lap
and i found her galling
and i roughed her up
<|endoftext|>

you'll always be a hyena etc
yells the devil who'd crowned me with such pretty poppies
deserve death with all your appetites your selfishness and all the capital sins
<|endoftext|>

ah
i've been through too much:-but sweet satan i beg of you a less blazing eye
and while waiting for the new little cowardly gestures yet to come since you like an absence of descriptive or didactic skills in a writer let me rip out these few ghastly pages from my notebook of the damned
<|endoftext|>

because non shall be spared
i'll change that friendly look
with a kiss of my cold steer
<|endoftext|>

scents of fear fill the street
sweat trickles in the heat
a scream a trip  fall
<|endoftext|>

bold lawman answers call
gently he takes her arm
i'll keep you safe from harm
<|endoftext|>

in a bar
where no one knows
who you are
<|endoftext|>

look at the sky of the fragrant freshness inhale deep the spirit of life
through the half-opened window tender rays paint your hair golden shine from the cages sing the birds the melody of morning let me kiss you a good morning and whisper on your ears the prayers for you for a day
life goes on from charming mornings to weary evenings
<|endoftext|>

on the rainy nights look at the skies heavy of darkness you may find stars twinkling brightness
my dear they are my eyes looking at you to see you growing with all my love to fulfill the dreams i abandoned here to see you carry the traces of this life lived futile
wake up to another morning cherishing the night and walk unto the path through eternity
<|endoftext|>

so delicate and frigil
wavy locks mighty thoughts
lips that beat the rain swept land
<|endoftext|>

knowing themselves too well in one another
their gifts no pure fruition but a thorn
the prick filed sharp against a hint of scorn
<|endoftext|>

dulce ridens dulce loquens
she shaves her legs until they gleam
like petrified mammoth-tusk
<|endoftext|>

our blight has been our sinecure
mere talent was enough for us
glitter in fragments and rough drafts
<|endoftext|>

droplets fall atop our necks
the bakers grim the farmers grin
the birds aloft the winds soar off
<|endoftext|>

her voice soft and sonorous a fresh timbre angelic
a discreet smile she did redeem as a reaction cyclic
and her blanched hand i kissed with devoutness
<|endoftext|>

oh
the first flowers how their scent liberates perfumes
and the first sounds they emit akin to charming murmur
<|endoftext|>

trembling breathless
our mother tries to rise on stork-thin legs
her face confused wasting into shadow
<|endoftext|>

our fierce warrior is dying
her voice falls down and down
we hold her upright wishing she could fly
<|endoftext|>

'shanti

he himself must be
the key now to the next door
the next terrors of freedom and joy
<|endoftext|>

when a man knows another man
is looking for him
he doesn't hide
<|endoftext|>

he puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit
and goes to the barber shop
to let another man shave him
<|endoftext|>

he shuts his eyes
remembers himself as a boy
lying naked on a rock by the water
<|endoftext|>

fictional vista
lulls us with fleeting solace
and euphoria's blue waves
<|endoftext|>

but when the day dies
we're consumed by fire of facts
and by its million facets
<|endoftext|>

lights come on my eyes open
keep breathing he says
i still feel frozen
<|endoftext|>

until death rode the winds like a brass knocker and begged for attention
of course the birds had cried themselves hoarse
frogs had croaked non-stop
<|endoftext|>

and now the house was up for sale
the theatre group didn't want it
wanted only the money
<|endoftext|>

not the sentimental shroud of an old man
not the front porch that reached out to strangers like a handshake
not the sunlight that fell just short of good feng shui
<|endoftext|>

i live yet do not live in me
am waiting as my life goes by
and die because i do not die
<|endoftext|>

but each man carries to his grave
the kisses that in hopes to save
the angel or his mother gave
<|endoftext|>

if i should sleep with a lady called death
get another man with firmer lips
to take your new mouth in his teeth
<|endoftext|>

yet even as i ponder all at stake
i sometimes really wish
the earth would quake
<|endoftext|>

i am parched now and my tongue is horrible in my mouth
but my brain is noisy
with the clash and gurgle of filling wine-cups
<|endoftext|>

the itch prevails
the tags in the mind
don't respond
<|endoftext|>

a jackal doesn't understand remorse
lions and lice don't waver in their course
why should they when they know they're right
<|endoftext|>

on this third planet of the sun
among the signs of bestiality
a clear conscience is number one
<|endoftext|>

can you see what i mean
can you see with every word i write
that proclaim a dream
<|endoftext|>

what they see is transmitted
to god's control room
which is beyond our understanding
<|endoftext|>

i want to be a bee digging into an onion heart
as you did to me dug and squatted
long after death and its fang
<|endoftext|>

with a voice less loud though its
joys and fears show wool in dissembled
colours shine
<|endoftext|>

it was on a day in spring
to find my way i had to travel long
in that unknown land
<|endoftext|>

yet a million thoughts racing in every second ahead
i look across the lawn small shoes and tidy dress
seems so perfect on my friends
<|endoftext|>

mysteriously she growl licking my face with her damp tongue holding tightly tightly to avoid any asunder
on top of my bed stands billy the bitch get of me
i strike like thunder
<|endoftext|>

i might be able to fidn the dream road by spontaneously walking
to meet the new day with flaming eyes
instead of the flame of a burnt-out cigarette
<|endoftext|>

one that leads to adversity by others but contentment for ones soul
and the other way round is just to prove self in front of others at the cost of self aspirations
at last the question remains
<|endoftext|>

is the air clear there as thoreau's prose
with frost and sparkling water and day's close
as mild as soft as shows in 'evangeline
<|endoftext|>

the stuff of liberty is a varying stuff

lee's men nobleness should never want

o zushio - is anju within your shadow
or has fate parted even the two of you
as it has parted us all
<|endoftext|>

everyone shouts out
it
is fun to cook together as family
<|endoftext|>

no one is born who is not born to die
chisel that truth and etch it into stone
idealism just cannot shield the bone
<|endoftext|>

spring has arrived
all the children's faces
smiling and alive
<|endoftext|>

the light trying to leap from his bones
and continue living unafraid unearthed
by age
<|endoftext|>

standing in the hushed twilight before frogs begin to sing i listen to the last ship's bell signal the wane of day
my exuberant heart beats as to leap from my chest
i wait in the crystal moonlight that reunites family so we may go as one in search of the glorious future that awaits father and son
<|endoftext|>

the intersection so that little girl who passes every day
with her yellow hair ties will look up and think of the moon
or of flowers
<|endoftext|>

go back home go
before it's very late
spend time together
<|endoftext|>

in all you do
ensure that love supports your role
nirvana's bliss will comfort you
<|endoftext|>

but there is a stay
you can stop
time as it dribbles from you drop by drop
<|endoftext|>

son
now i am afraid
what is there to be known
<|endoftext|>

son
i begin to understand the reason for evasion
i cannot partake of your difficult vision
<|endoftext|>

i wonder if donovan listens to sound just to drown
his voice
music has its way with memory
<|endoftext|>

of eleven planets i dreamt
and of the sun and the moon
all kneeling before me
<|endoftext|>

each time i walked by
i dreamed of the promise
hiding behind its doors
<|endoftext|>

you ponder ramifications
forced upon you
by the winds of fate
<|endoftext|>

i would be forever scarred by the memory
of the hopes i had for us both the things that we
could have grown to be
<|endoftext|>

he called out to animals
he felt the earth firm and
yielding under his bare feet
<|endoftext|>

i am the reflection of all that is good
and beautiful and wonderful
on this earth
<|endoftext|>

and suddenly
it spread its wings and took off
off into the sky
<|endoftext|>

then he shed all his things
slowly and steadily
removing all the physical rings
<|endoftext|>

ha
hunger and thirst
i do not need you
<|endoftext|>

i have to work and slave
because of you
be gone
<|endoftext|>

but
but i ensure that
your body is nourished
<|endoftext|>

i only know that
you have made me miserable
when i don't satisfy you
<|endoftext|>

we have in our hands
the seeds of all you have thrown
without a stance
<|endoftext|>

as i was flying
admiring my flight and
regretting his lack of wings
<|endoftext|>

even if you aren't with me
i may not miss
but hardly waiting for first kiss
<|endoftext|>

which is why death never ends
the game like a hawk chasing a crow
chased off by crows
<|endoftext|>

like a god with huge blue eyes and limbs of snow
the sea and sky lure to the marble terraces
the throng of roses young and strong
<|endoftext|>

some actions do not change the world
and some are more dangerous than
we could possibly fathom
<|endoftext|>

tomorrow
what time is now

she is happy
there she resides in peaceful bliss
no more pain
<|endoftext|>

only one letter
so you start your path by a blank page
clear
<|endoftext|>

a photograph on the desk
it tells tales of youths travels from place to place in time
of lessons learned the hard way
<|endoftext|>

choices left
wars occurred that took our dreams away left us all alone
a time in the past
<|endoftext|>

we finally saw the light in the window
it only took a lifetime to hear the answers and see the truth
a time in the past
<|endoftext|>

we are children without gifts
and christmas morning was pre-empted
by the state of the union address
<|endoftext|>

that makes me so alone
one that no longer cares for the others in need
where people are discarded
<|endoftext|>

a world so different
i know a world that has made me untouchable
that turns its back on those like me
<|endoftext|>

afternoons
they are always like this
eternally afternoons
<|endoftext|>

no mister banker
it is not a bright and happy eye
it's the fever of a trophy hunter

do you want to crawl down the walk of ghosts
or proudly tread the alley of justice
<|endoftext|>

saturated by whispering
squirrels daring me
to climb their trees
<|endoftext|>

to many i have seen to many i have believe
if not by my wicked ways to achieve a conquerable belief
then it should be done by my own music
<|endoftext|>

i felt i was getting enraged
and losing my speech
like them losing their dreams
<|endoftext|>

why are you vegetarian
the friend asked
don't you like chicken and burgers
<|endoftext|>

in times of trouble
friends will say
just ask
<|endoftext|>

good luck on your journey
you take with you the tears that i gave you
and my sleep that you stole
<|endoftext|>

i could forget my lover
were it not for the stars
which remind me
<|endoftext|>

comely am i and black
pitch-black letters like the black tents of kedar
on paper like the white tents of solomon
<|endoftext|>

here for you are the fruits of my poetry
ripe after months of waiting
but for my love you need never wait
<|endoftext|>

the morning breeze warms the face of every lover
but to me it shall always say: all is well with solomon
shalom
<|endoftext|>

just thought i'd tell you
while you're sinking
whirling down my well
<|endoftext|>

i'll always be here for you
when there's no one out there
to comfort you
<|endoftext|>

at last she put her gum away
upon a special little tray
and settled back and went to sleep
<|endoftext|>

if you are the lamp of the heart know where the road is to the
house and if you are godlike of attribute know that i am your
maser
<|endoftext|>

i don't know why
somehow i've left undone
my moral fly

the tree azalea overwhelms the evening with its scent defining everything and the endless fields
walking away suddenly it slices off and is gone
the visible object blurs open in front of you the outline of a branch folds back into itself then clarifies just as you turn away and the glass hardens into glassas you go about taking care of things abstractedlyone thing shelved after another as if they were already in the past needing nothing from you until smashing itself on the tile floor the present cracks open the aftermath of itself

he stamped his feet and opened the door stood on the threshold turned around
the desert light shrank his eyes sun slammed his face he almost lost his breath blond shiny grasses ring of distant mountains pinking in the haze the scorched but somehow fertile earth he wiped his brow he couldn't go in he couldn't move he couldn't say why as if he too were a thing dried in sunlight stopped in his tracks in the heat that fixed him in its gaze rattlesnake medusa where he breathed the stinging dusty winds as though a rock inhaling rock his proper evolution
and fed on silence as it flowered and fell the fierce clarity the fierce restraint front door behind him hanging open like a thrown shadow as he blazed in place
<|endoftext|>

i saw a man pursuing the horizon round and round they sped
i was disturbed at this i accosted the man
it is futile i said you can never you lie he cried and ran on

a rough sound was polished until it became a smoother sound which was polished until it became music
then the music was polished until it became the memory of a night in venice when tears of the sea fell from the bridge of sighs which in turn was polished until it ceased to be and in its place stood the empty home of a heart in trouble
then suddenly there was sun and the music came back and traffic was moving and off in the distance at the edge of the city a long line of clouds appeared and there was thunder which however menacing would become music and the memory of what happened after venice would begin and what happened after the home of the troubled heart broke in two would also begin
<|endoftext|>

that we had lived together forever and did

my little baby who i will name a weaver of spools and not of dreams with mortal limbs not quite sinew not quite bone paddles a rowboat inside of me and i stay in those moments ever-so-still so that she may reach out to me
the midwife says that what i'm feeling is called quickening
scientists say that she is dreaming practicing for this life i like to think where in her nursery there will be a machine projecting fake moonbeams and fake stars and fake shadows and fake birds and fake clouds to storm over her

i saw once in a rose garden a remarkable statue of the roman she-wolf and her twins a reproduction of an ancient statue not the famous bronze statue so often copied in which the blunt head swings forward toward the viewer like a sad battering ram but an even older statue of provenance less clear
the wolf had been cut out of black stone made blacker by the garden's shadows and she stood in profile her elegant head pointed toward something far beyond her her long unmarked body and legs narrower and more finely-boned than the body and legs of wolves as we know them possessed it seemed of a great stillness like the saturated stillness of the roses but tightly-nerved set on the instant to move
under her belly stood the boys under her black breasts not babes as one might expect but two lean boys cut from the same shadowed stone as the wolf but disproportionately small grown boys no bigger than starlings though still like the wolf oddly fine of face and limb one boy pressing four fingers again one long breast his other cupped beneath it to catch the falling milk the second boy wrapping both arms around another breast as if to carry it off neither boy suckling both instead turned toward you dreamy sweetly sly as if to chide you for interrupting their feeding or as if they were plotting a good trick
<|endoftext|>

beautiful those boys among the roses
beautiful the black wolf
but it was the breasts that held the eye a double row of four black breasts eight smooth breasts each narrowing to a strict point piercing sharp exactly the shape of the ivory tooth of the shark
<|endoftext|>

i have nothing to say to you really
i just want to see what i'm looking at
i want so much not to listen to you after all this time but to hear
<|endoftext|>

but i'll sing it to myself
i'll sing it to the small moth the size of scarcely a word
ad libitum according to my desire

she compared the man to plants to the plants having a nervous aspect and being motionless
the man coming when he had the sense of being delayed in leaving as if being slowed down had made him come and was exciting and it was during the afternoon with people walking around
he was late and had to go somewhere and came with a feeling of delay and retarding rather than out of nervousness

as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill
i was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles
an elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty green iron table saying: if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden

before the curtain falls

<|endoftext|>

she's a pair of scissors
trimming lament
to allow for all i don't know
<|endoftext|>

and look at those prehistoric feet
no doubt she's realized the secret to surviving
her own tribe's slaughter and dispersal
<|endoftext|>

words move
but the word is fixed
the true blank
<|endoftext|>

wind from an axe that struck wood
a hundred years ago
lifts the thin flags of the town
<|endoftext|>

pulling the white sheet
over your bare shoulder
i marry you again
<|endoftext|>

as the late sun lit up an orchard
behind the strip mall
and they sat in the dark holding hands
<|endoftext|>

that's how much he's missed you good dog
companion dog dog-of-all-types most excellent dog
i told you once and for all we should never get
<|endoftext|>

in a sacred wood
they say
tomorrow we are gone
<|endoftext|>

and she strolls calmly away pecking and pausing
not watching him astonished to discover
all these seeds spread just for her in the dirt
<|endoftext|>

like turtles they are quite self-contained
if they seem sad it is only the same sadness
we all feel unlovely growing slowly cold
<|endoftext|>

echo of the clocktower footstep
in the alleyway sweep
of the wind sifting the leaves
<|endoftext|>

jeweller of the spiderweb connoisseur
of autumn's opulence blade of lightning
harvesting the sky
<|endoftext|>

keeper of the small gate choreographer
of entrances and exits midnight
whisper traveling the wires
<|endoftext|>

we shared chocolate and one man from maine
told a joke
suns were everywhere at our feet
<|endoftext|>

his paycheck at the harley house roared off
with nothing but a backpack waving his headband
leaning into a downhill curve and gone
<|endoftext|>

i never
saw you that way marilyn
though perhaps incomplete
<|endoftext|>

the angel sees a pinewood box in place of the man
and the street he walks is a boat
the hull like a coal crater
<|endoftext|>

where was i expecting death
to take me if everywhere it is
is on earth
<|endoftext|>

it's burning hot the heat coming
from bugs and worms
raping and devouring one another
<|endoftext|>

he starts the hard work
of the imagination
learning to minister to the new dream
<|endoftext|>

against the blue good luck to it my sister and i below
heads tilted back as we stand in the grass good
luck to all of us still here still in love with it
<|endoftext|>

i'd do this every few minutes
i'd think to myself
what made me such a failure
<|endoftext|>

here comes lucretius then ovid then horace
in lines saying relentlessly doily doily
till stars take over and do the same
<|endoftext|>

why have you pushed him from his world into mine
stopped him there and turned his ear
toward my warning shout
<|endoftext|>

bless the elsewhere
where others are
not here or you
<|endoftext|>

as laughing now brushing confetti away you hand
the bride flowers narcissi their green throats pushing up
from wet stones in a jar
<|endoftext|>

are there to be sat through waited out
on a damp bench as a man sweeps up around you
and the sun comes out in real time stealing over the ground
<|endoftext|>

and leapt away
a white tooth
in the closing mouth of the woods
<|endoftext|>

i am coming i am about
to come your shuddering
lover your raz el hanout
<|endoftext|>

of zaatar bread and diet cokes
we found some shade under a portico
as the visionary pillars disappeared into blue sky
<|endoftext|>

what questions were we asking
staring at the misinformation on the wall
and the beautiful armenian head of anahit
<|endoftext|>

why was i back in der zor at the chapel
digging armenian bones out of the baked ground
scratching the marrow and dried mildew
<|endoftext|>

that might mean
those cloudy bastards
have noticed me
<|endoftext|>

in offering as much for
show as for a fear so deep
i found i couldn't name it
<|endoftext|>

in a forest on a train in new york
and paris with unparalleled handiwork sinning
as i go merry as an office boy spooning onion soup
<|endoftext|>

the body held so long
by stewards
in her name
<|endoftext|>

when the great bass stomped its galloping boom out
to the crowd my heart swelled with valor and pride
i remembered when we saluted when we took off our hat
<|endoftext|>

a mongoose charges dry grass and fades through a fence
faster than an afterthought
dust rises easily
<|endoftext|>

desire them but cannot want such order
we stand mouths open and cannot help
stammering our secrets nailed to water
<|endoftext|>

along which
randomly clucks
the whole game
<|endoftext|>

sound inside their years
surely i have known the whole
of grief and grace in gears
<|endoftext|>

thing took her place in front of us
arranged in cuneiform polished
brandishing a window to climb out
<|endoftext|>

a thresh of sticks and vine hand-carried
high ay am my own weight carried by
kind horse kind mother gone
<|endoftext|>

one cartwheel over the quicksand curve
of tuesday to tuesday and you're gone
summering a ship on the farthest wave
<|endoftext|>

sometimes imagining that greedy zero
you must have been that promising empty sack
of possibilities never-to-come tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

but look at you now body soft old shoe
that love wears when it's stirring look down look
how earth wants what you weigh needs what you know
<|endoftext|>

to be exact it happened the very first time
that i saw rome darkness falling as i left
causing me to see what simply couldn't last
<|endoftext|>

i'm a pipe cleaner
a drop of moisture on the big nose
a pushing landscape indecipherable
<|endoftext|>

as she touches a fingertip to a word
to mark her place and turns her head
toward the kettle that has begun to whistle
<|endoftext|>

my dog has died
i buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine
<|endoftext|>

to my breathing whispered
praise my slightest
suggestion
<|endoftext|>

to me to each other by my will
by love to that other realm
by song and tooth and blood
<|endoftext|>

who knows what will become of them
before they
find their peace
<|endoftext|>

from a sun shower
who's arrived dripping wet an idea
fresh from the brush of his maker
<|endoftext|>

i found him going through the public trash
figuring how to fill a bottle
some angry drunk had smashed
<|endoftext|>

to hear
i read until you finally slept
and all your jagged syntaxes softened into rest
<|endoftext|>

whose poems drifted like a dinghy
in small inlets gravesend rockaway
out too far for safety in sight of land
<|endoftext|>

collect red bug bites
show you a peacock before
his tail gets ratty
<|endoftext|>

the lapping of lake water and a call of one bird
then another cries of joy or warning
it passes the time to wonder which
<|endoftext|>

back out
mary i am still
for you i am still a numbness for you
<|endoftext|>

i'd sit on the bench
(i didn't look out of the eyeholes
so i wouldn't see the carnage
<|endoftext|>

vii
a transmission through space
a dismemberment of the spirit
<|endoftext|>

viii
years later i came back
wanting to be known
<|endoftext|>

for five more years
then the wailing
then the dust
<|endoftext|>

the silver drops
the spider's hour
the mirror
<|endoftext|>

when the bees fly out tomorrow to look for sweetness
and find their way
because nothing else has changed
<|endoftext|>

see snow falls for the first time every year and every year
my students rush to the window as if snow were more interesting
than math which of course it is
<|endoftext|>

there falls each ancient barrier that the art
of race or creed or rank devised to rear
grim bulwarked hatred between heart and heart
<|endoftext|>

though wild beneath the daemonic pressure
of his inquiry (with so much of the trowel
surely a touch more finishing might be borne
<|endoftext|>

and later
you stood mighty in the door on james street
loud callin
<|endoftext|>

we struggle vainly still we fain would catch
such rifts amid life's shadows for they bring
glimpses ineffable of things divine
<|endoftext|>

you
you
a poet
<|endoftext|>

but still she looked good to me she still looked good
and all thanks to an ugly horse
who wrote this poem
<|endoftext|>

my typewriter is
tombstone
still
<|endoftext|>

and i am
reduced to bird
watching
<|endoftext|>

he walks away
thinking about
it
<|endoftext|>

now take a close look
do you find
it has another row behind
<|endoftext|>

some would be devoted to acting against consciousness
like the flight of a moth which had it known
would have tended nevertheless toward the candle's flame
<|endoftext|>

i would deal separately with satisfaction and pride
the time when i was among their adherents
who strut victoriously unsuspecting
<|endoftext|>

the history of my stupidity will not be written
for one thing it's late
and the truth is laborious
<|endoftext|>

pencil or warps
of a flat eye
the wide world circling
<|endoftext|>

by whose bald sign i know
that stooping age away shall pull
which youthful years did sow
<|endoftext|>

for beauty with her band
these crooked cares hath wrought
from whence i first was brought
<|endoftext|>

ah ah groans the crew with the weight the winds cutting skin
we claim our seats
pelicans perch in the draft for fish
<|endoftext|>

ah ah calls the sun from a fishing boat with a pale yellow sail
we fly by
on our return over the net of eternity thrown out for stars
<|endoftext|>

in the chill rains of the early winter i hear something
a puling anger a cold wind stiffened by flying bone
out of the north
<|endoftext|>

thestylis
what you cannot constant hope
must be taken as you may
<|endoftext|>

ametas
then let's both lay by our rope
and go kiss within the hay
<|endoftext|>

what then can move her
if not merth nor mone
she is no woman but a sencelesse stone
<|endoftext|>

haunting the sacred well the hidden shrine
it is the ravage of the heron wood
it is the rood blazing upon the green
<|endoftext|>

and where my organ of veneration should be
wormwood and gall
grudge sliver
<|endoftext|>

the nurse said of the bedsore
everything exists
at the courtesy of everything else
<|endoftext|>

deer do not tremble i know this
my bone and sinew twisted into fallow
slenderness and the tibia twig thin
<|endoftext|>

four rods finished with a cloven
hoof planted on rotting leaf mould
gloomy weight of the gold altar
<|endoftext|>

despite the blood threat of power
my doe body would not spring away
no flick of spotted fur into shadow
<|endoftext|>

and fills the lost ring's
hollow with life's most lasting
part cries for new love
<|endoftext|>

low in the east now lighting gorgeously
he saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed
to pluck the sun down into the dead sea
<|endoftext|>

stasis in darkness
then the substanceless blue
pour of tor and distances
<|endoftext|>

hauls me through air
thighs hair
flakes from my heels
<|endoftext|>

white
godiva i unpeel
dead hands dead stringencies
<|endoftext|>

nearness without contact
causes numbness
analgesia
<|endoftext|>

pins and needles
as the snugness
of the surgeon's glove causes hand fatigue
<|endoftext|>

hans memling is watching from my matchbox
where the serpent lives
this is his nest
<|endoftext|>

woman was made to serve and obey man
man must obey god
wife: man can command
<|endoftext|>

a few capricious tourists off the cozy track
propose unbeaten toasts
he'll soon be going back
<|endoftext|>

an amble to the john the mirror's random crack
the urinal's askew
he'll soon be going back
<|endoftext|>

dusty carnations carnival bric-a-brac
long-faded revaltions
he'll soon be going back
<|endoftext|>

into so few words respectfully asks glatstein
wang wei at first doesn't understand the problem
but then he shrugs his shoulders mumbles zen
<|endoftext|>

a wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt
brings the scent
of wounded horses
<|endoftext|>

sucking your benumbed
trigger-finger
gamer's thumb
<|endoftext|>

diseased the last elm falls and with it falls
the indistinct last glint of dionysus
lysius
<|endoftext|>

now this is it
if the spirit was just
why did the maid weep
<|endoftext|>

s stacked high
as a dag
wood sammich
<|endoftext|>

an elegant hotel
the iron fretwork of the el
held each room in a deep corrosive bloom
<|endoftext|>

this was the bankrupt's last chance the place
the gambler waits to learn his black mare's
leg snapped as she hurtled towards the finish line
<|endoftext|>

trains hurtled by extinguished somewhere
past the bend of midnight
the shuddering world
<|endoftext|>

dante and john chrysostom
might find this afternoon a sidereal roadmap
a pilgrim's way
<|endoftext|>

snapping refusing and spitting high
till the steel teeth got gritty corners on them
and could grip them craw-chokingly to grind
<|endoftext|>

i heard a gandy dancer playing on a jew's harp
where is now that merry party i remember long ago
nelly was a lady
<|endoftext|>

cathedrals and snails the breaking of this new day
and the shadows of the beach road near which my mother lies
with the traffic of insects going to work anyway
<|endoftext|>

eve
magdalene
or mary you
<|endoftext|>

i am the blossom pressed in a book
found again after two hundred years
i am the maker the lover and the keeper
<|endoftext|>

i am the one whose love
overcomes you already with you
when you think to call my name
<|endoftext|>

wetter warmed they watch
the mason meditate
on name and date
<|endoftext|>

delight dwindles
blame
stays the same
<|endoftext|>

name and date
split in soft slate
a few months obliterate
<|endoftext|>

not dancing but nearly risen
through barnlike theatrelike houses
on the wings of the buck and wing
<|endoftext|>

quick dance shuffle of losses and leaves
only the things i didn't do
crackle after the blazing dies
<|endoftext|>

forever splendor of fog snow shut strangers out
gradual turn of season ground stir pine
needle tickle your shoulder peak curve fresh air
<|endoftext|>

a sequined empress
a mirage in loungewear and
harlequin glasses
<|endoftext|>

of fur
i will teach you to be still as an egg
and to slip like the ghost of wind through the grass
<|endoftext|>

the end of june's its garden july its fall
all else the world remembering what it was
in the seven days of its visible miracle
<|endoftext|>

what's lost
a possible us
growing like new foliage out of stony ground emerging
<|endoftext|>

last voice first a whole world calling
awful inaudible into the unstoppable loud
hurricane-force sea wind
<|endoftext|>

ah you are being faraway too kind
dark beautiful cabala
goodbye gentlemens
<|endoftext|>

chicago is an overgrown woman
wearing her skyscrapers
like a necklace
<|endoftext|>

there will always be new wordless songs new humless tunes
chicago sings these songs each day
chicago who wears her skyscrapers like a necklace
<|endoftext|>

on which i weekly write without conviction
'no longer living here
address unknown
<|endoftext|>

and though we had some chance of slipping past the blockade
now only time will consent to have anything to do with us
for what purposes we do not know
<|endoftext|>

swirl sleeping in the waterfall
on motionless pools scum appearing
disappearing
<|endoftext|>

eaves formal on the zenith
lofty city kyoto
wealthy without antiquities
<|endoftext|>

in the town where i was known
the young men stare at me
a few faces i know remain
<|endoftext|>

i have heard of a time when kings beneath bark rooves
watched chimneys
when smoke was scarce taxes were remitted
<|endoftext|>

somehow or other
neither palace nor straw-hut
is quite satisfactory
<|endoftext|>

those are fireflies that seem
the fishermen's lights
off maki island
<|endoftext|>

a shower at dawn
sings
like the hillbreeze in the leaves
<|endoftext|>

i came here for a month
five years ago
there's moss on the roof
<|endoftext|>

and i hear soanso's dead
back in kyoto
i have as much room as i need
<|endoftext|>

the moonshadow merges with darkness
on the cliffpath
a tricky turn near ahead
<|endoftext|>

oh
there's nothing to complain about
i am fond of my hut
<|endoftext|>

i have renounced the world
have a saintly
appearance
<|endoftext|>

so i traced these words on the bark of a beech
just at the falling of the mast
after scanning five yes each and each
<|endoftext|>

all the five women clear come back
the while she drooped upon the track
and her frail term seemed well-nigh run
<|endoftext|>

who will honor the city without a name
if so many are dead and others pan gold
or sell arms in faraway countries
<|endoftext|>

what shepherd's horn swathed in the bark of birch
will sound in the ponary hills the memory of the absent
vagabonds pathfinders brethren of a dissolved lodge
<|endoftext|>

this spring in a desert beyond a campsite flagpole
in silence that stretched to the solid rock of yellow and red mountains
i heard in a gray bush the buzzing of wild bees
<|endoftext|>

the current carried an echo and the timber of rafts
a man in a visored cap and a woman in a kerchief
pushed hard with their four hands at a heavy steering oar
<|endoftext|>

in the library below a tower painted with the signs of the zodiac
kontrym would take a whiff from his snuffbox and smile
for despite metternich all was not yet lost
<|endoftext|>

in death valley salt gleams from a dried-up lake bed
defend defend yourself says the tick-tock of the blood
from the futility of solid rock no wisdom
<|endoftext|>

understanding and pity
we value them highly
what else
<|endoftext|>

beauty and kisses
fame and its prizes
who cares
<|endoftext|>

doctors and lawyers
well-turned-out majors
six feet of earth
<|endoftext|>

rings furs and lashes
glances at masses
rest in peace
<|endoftext|>

sweet twin breasts good night
sleep through to the light
without spiders
<|endoftext|>

oh yes i wanted to be me
i toasted mirrors weepily
and learned my own stupidity
<|endoftext|>

so what else is new
i am not my own friend
time cuts me in two
<|endoftext|>

they trot before me on embankment street two hently born parakeets
from samogitia and at night they unravel their spinster tresses of gray
hair
<|endoftext|>

rattling their wheels courier and speedy move against the current
to werki and an oarsman shot down over england skiffs past spread
eagled by his oars
<|endoftext|>

at st
peter and paul's the angels lower their thick eyelids in a smile
over a nun who has indecent thoughts
<|endoftext|>

how it glitters
the snow on three crosses hill and bekiesz hill not
to be melted by the breath of these brief lives
<|endoftext|>

the castle tower above the leafy tumulus grows small and there is still
a hardly audible is it mozart's requiem
music
<|endoftext|>

i said
no to you
so often couldn't see
<|endoftext|>

oh please my love i want to rock and roll with you
feel it feel it
feel it all night like a shoe
<|endoftext|>

and the outline of the claw
footed bathtub font
of the lost cathedral of childhood
<|endoftext|>

looking back the glistening leaf is still moving
all of dry old me is crumpled like the hills of feed
and a slick me like a huge calf is coming out of me
<|endoftext|>

the carrion-stinking dog who is calf of human and wolf
is chasing and eating little blood things the humans scatter
and all me run away over smells toward the sky
<|endoftext|>

i watched
the water spiral up in them like smoke
beautiful yes but not much company
<|endoftext|>

the bliss of what
one of the first things that i did
when i got back was look it up
<|endoftext|>

i knew each nick and scratch by heart
the bluish blade the broken tip
the lines of wood-grain on the handle
<|endoftext|>

now it won't look at me at all
the living soul has dribbled away
my eyes rest on it and pass on
<|endoftext|>

four months i'll see her see him again
now i walk home along the river
into the wind as the clouds break open
<|endoftext|>

alas
i have not hope nor health
nor peace within etc
<|endoftext|>

he would abolish the rights of
property he would overthrow
the constitution
<|endoftext|>

two weeks later they
ran me out
of town
<|endoftext|>

whether or not we use it it goes
and leaves what something hidden from us chose
and age and then the only end of age
<|endoftext|>

your feet descending the stairs any
moment any moment the whole world
all i want of the world coming down
<|endoftext|>

he turned to look at the women
and eller shot him in the back with a pistol
just where his suspenders crossed
<|endoftext|>

he assured her it was quinine
bought where he had always bought it
and she drank it
<|endoftext|>

off-field outside the park beyond
the gates something was burning
the smell was everywhere
<|endoftext|>

which still was panting part of it was true
oh how i strove the rest to have believed
ashamed and angry to be undeceived
<|endoftext|>

yes grass
unequivocal grass
just grass
<|endoftext|>

waterfall and thought of him
pushing back from a bar
to go make the same noise
<|endoftext|>

the function as it seems to me
o' poetry is to bring to be
at lang lang last that unity
<|endoftext|>

how much shall i love her
for life or not long
not long
<|endoftext|>

and whom woo i after
no one or a throng
a throng
<|endoftext|>

of these shall i wed one
long hence or quite soon
quite soon
<|endoftext|>

and which will my bride be
the right or the wrong
the wrong
<|endoftext|>

it is a scene shot with shades of grey
the smoke the animal the reported facts
on a seasonably grey and gloomy day
<|endoftext|>

the tide's a lamentation of white opals
the beach is free
the coke machine rusted out
<|endoftext|>

is it the sea you hear in me
its dissatisfactions
or the voice of nothing that was your madness
<|endoftext|>

love is a shadow
how you lie and cry after it
listen: these are its hooves: it has gone off like a horse
<|endoftext|>

all night i shall gallop thus impetuously
till your head is a stone your pillow a little turf
echoing echoing
<|endoftext|>

or shall i bring you the sound of poisons
this is rain now this big hush
and this is the fruit of it: tin-white like arsenic
<|endoftext|>

i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
scorched to the root
my red filaments burn and stand a hand of wires
<|endoftext|>

now i break up in pieces that fly about like clubs
a wind of such violence
will tolerate no bystanding: i must shriek
<|endoftext|>

i am inhabited by a cry
nightly it flaps out
looking with its hooks for something to love
<|endoftext|>

i am terrified by this dark thing
that sleeps in me
all day i feel its soft feathery turnings its malignity
<|endoftext|>

clouds pass and disperse
are those the faces of love those pale irretrievables
is it for such i agitate my heart
<|endoftext|>

the belled herds travel at will
long-legged and thirsty covered with foreign dust

from the lower forty-eight
the frog i trod sprang back
intact all its receptors set on july
<|endoftext|>

from which no care can save
and partner once of tiney's box
must soon partake his grave
<|endoftext|>

from this distance they are a grace
an ache
the kingdom inside
<|endoftext|>

the love you live
the life you give
everything is free
<|endoftext|>

his tongue tingled ripely
this country's foreign
to me he continued but i'm not foreign to it
<|endoftext|>

irreverent of tradition
he still took a princess as his lover
and let nations strike medals in his name
<|endoftext|>

the boot is famous to the earth
more famous than the dress shoe
which is famous only to floors
<|endoftext|>

i want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous
or a buttonhole not because it did anything spectacular
but because it never forgot what it could do
<|endoftext|>

darling all night
i have been flickering off on off on
the sheets grow heavy as a lecher'slecher a person with strong sexual desires lustful kiss
<|endoftext|>

you sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones
i am what you made to live in
from what you had: hair matted as kelp bad schools
<|endoftext|>

the world is bluer and of the earth
at night when i sleep
enormous within your small hands
<|endoftext|>

or find in our seamless
unravelling years
the tissue of apocalypse
<|endoftext|>

wagtail smart in his belted blue
primrose paying her gold ere due
these are the things that i know are true

his body swaying in the air
tomorrow you will learn what's true
hanging's a thing he's done for you
<|endoftext|>

rescue me from oblivion
syrup of skittish travelers fame
i yawn
<|endoftext|>

and they come with a real big black funky stud too
oh ma

little sphinxes i have instructed you to the best of my ability
who are you to mix up languages
this is not a smorgasbord

words indeed no more can show
but 'tis to love as i love you
<|endoftext|>

which considering the price
it would be a sin
not to enjoy
<|endoftext|>

if i could stir
i could break a tree
i could break you
<|endoftext|>

pigeons rustle in the eaves
at his feet the german shepherd
snaps its jaws in its sleep

very sad
<|endoftext|>

ostrich had found his voice at last
his own beauty
his big terrific self
<|endoftext|>

refreshes and relents

two fields back in the house small ripples shook
silently across our drinking water
and vanished into where they seemed to start
<|endoftext|>

so etymologist of roots and graftings
i fall back to my tree-house and would crouch
where small buds shoot and flourish in the hush
<|endoftext|>

the empty briar is swishing
when i come down and beyond inside your face
haunts like a new moon glimpsed through tangled glass
<|endoftext|>

ah
but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
<|endoftext|>

but when one fearless turned and clawed like bronze
cringing was easy to blunt these stern paws
and he would weigh the heavier on those after
<|endoftext|>

hence thou suborn'd informer
a true soul
when most impeach'd stands least in thy control
<|endoftext|>

and drew four slatterns in an attic
heavy with heads on arms asleep
who if they woke could only weep
<|endoftext|>

and knows he needs to have it or die and the one
who makes the general lose the world for love
lets him say would i had never seen her but oh
<|endoftext|>

the almost certainly invented heart
which buddha denounces in its endless changes
forever jumping and moving like an ape

no one can see that leads to who knows where
a seraph took a live coal from the altar
and seared the prophet's lips and so he spoke
<|endoftext|>

if you are comforted
by this thought you are welcome
to keep it
<|endoftext|>

naturally i just got right back in the car
and believe me was determined determined
to head straight for home
<|endoftext|>

the bawling pit-hooter and the god's
explosive foray vengeance before retreating
to his throne of sulphur
<|endoftext|>

when i kissed that socket with my wet lip
my teeth fell out my fingers sprouted chives
and what a bald head chewed on my sick heart
<|endoftext|>

yearning further into giving itself into the air breath
strained into song emptying the golden bell it comes from
the pure source poured altogether out and away
<|endoftext|>

true words end
lies extend
translated from the oromo
<|endoftext|>

you dweller in the dark cabin
rise since rising will not waken
and hail cry hail cry hail
<|endoftext|>

i maaku
the frigate birds fly high above us and i'm afraid of falling
i maaku
<|endoftext|>

only you back out into the world
i pray for you
to come and sit by me only a few more minutes now
<|endoftext|>

i hear a river thro' the valley wander
whose water runs the song alone remaining
a rainbow stands and summer passes under
<|endoftext|>

drive he sd for
christ's sake look
out where yr going
<|endoftext|>

do not come anymore
i am an animal
very rarely
<|endoftext|>

for one is both and both are one in love
both have the strength and both the length thereof
both of us of the love which makes us one
<|endoftext|>

how far
this might be from the night of christmas
if it were not for you
<|endoftext|>

inside his brain one so much making another
it was impossible to tell them all
in the court-culture of jokes a top banana
<|endoftext|>

gets home from work they'll be okay till morning
it's laughter versus the bedroom and the pills
what is he in his efforts but a courtier
<|endoftext|>

in a way that on his side went back to yiddish
on sandra's to some sicilian dialect
he used to scold her endlessly for smoking
<|endoftext|>

so out of hand the army could barely function
finally one commander assembled his men
in one great room to deal with things directly
<|endoftext|>

in kyoto
hearing the cuckoo
i long for kyoto
<|endoftext|>

when i am tired of only touching
i have my mouth to try to tell you
what in your arms is not erased
<|endoftext|>

or even worth seeing at all
but the spirit of this place just the same
felt here as joy
<|endoftext|>

the ballast that keeps us upright loyal
to the dark deep-bedded throne
of the old country each new soul claims as its own
<|endoftext|>

of night the enormous florida night
metallic with cicadas musical
and dangerous as the human heart
<|endoftext|>

the paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws
and the musicians mingle among them in their creamy white uniforms and talk
about the weather perhaps or how their kids are doing at school
<|endoftext|>

and as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower i turn my
gaze
back to the instruction manual which has made me dream of guadalajara
<|endoftext|>

and the knife
drawn over skin and dermis made a sound
of satin tearing
<|endoftext|>

you're only imagining all this
look the butterfly's already
bringing the flowers back
<|endoftext|>

the painting
soapsuds and whitewash
the critics described it so
<|endoftext|>

but you are a poet
you pretend to make poems
and
<|endoftext|>

he who had scrawled
on his cuffs on envelope scraps on market paper in his little pad
robins' trills girls' chatter at the railway station
<|endoftext|>

he was led to be hanged
how
to write this scene
<|endoftext|>

the stones tucked themselves under his feet
two magpies stalked him
poplar to poplar
<|endoftext|>

a truck
with sides already dropped
above it  a noose
<|endoftext|>

and if you find her poor ithaka won't have fooled you
wise as you will have become so full of experience
you'll have understood by then what these ithakas mean
<|endoftext|>

i've got most of the grease off and onto this little square
of paper
i'm folding it now making creases with my nails
<|endoftext|>

so there was janet
kneeling on the wet grass crying her brown hen
to rise and walk upon it
<|endoftext|>

instead i have told my story over and over
at parties on the edge of meetings my life
clenched in my fist my eyes brittle as glass
<|endoftext|>

out of the fog a man in wranglers and
spurred boots clean-shaven a cigarette
in hand waved me down
<|endoftext|>

the fog was lifting off the fern-scalded
mountains across the bay and the sheep
marked red and blue looked like sweaters
<|endoftext|>

we passed the rusted hulls
of fishing boats and the scaffolding
of floating mussel beds
<|endoftext|>

when lord haw haw broadcast for the nazis
from right here do ya think he was
a traitor or a patriot
<|endoftext|>

i couldn't bring myself to tell him
i was on sabbatical and looking for
a place to write
<|endoftext|>

maeve's mountain
two hours from
here in the other direction
<|endoftext|>

we've gone to sleep back to chest
the way lips rejoin
after sighing
<|endoftext|>

the crowd is sauntering at its ease
and humming like a hive of bees
you take your seat and touch the keys
<|endoftext|>

i do not hear the giddy throng
the sea avenges israel's wrong
and on the wind floats miriam's song
<|endoftext|>

you join me with a stately grace
music to poesy gives place
some grand emotion lights your face
<|endoftext|>

at once i stand by mizpeh's walls
with smiles the martyred daughter falls
and desolate are mizpeh's halls
<|endoftext|>

intrusive babblers come between
with calm pale brow and lofty mien
you thread the circle like a queen
<|endoftext|>

then sweeps the royal esther by
the deep devotion in her eye
is looking if i die i die
<|endoftext|>

you stroll the garden's flowery walks
the plants to me are grainless stalks
and ruth to old naomi talks
<|endoftext|>

adopted child of judah's creed
like judah's daughters true at need
i see you mid the alien seed
<|endoftext|>

i watch afar the gleaner sweet
i wake like boaz in the wheat
and find you lying at my feet
<|endoftext|>

this is number three
what a trash
to annihilate each decade
<|endoftext|>

nevertheless i am the same identical woman
the first time it happened i was ten
it was an accident
<|endoftext|>

dying
is an art like everything else
i do it exceptionally well
<|endoftext|>

i do it so it feels like hell
i do it so it feels real
i guess you could say i've a call
<|endoftext|>

for the eyeing of my scars there is a charge
for the hearing of my heart
it really goes
<|endoftext|>

herr god herr lucifer
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

out of the ash
i rise with my red hair
and i eat men like air
<|endoftext|>

no
of course not
it won't
<|endoftext|>

what do i do
do i throw all these away
their anecdotes their comforts now black glass
<|endoftext|>

the unusual rilke
and the usual rilke
both knew it
<|endoftext|>

and you go to your men slapping fives feeling good
posing as a man because you know as long as you sit
very very still the laws of motion will be in effect
<|endoftext|>

swing magnet swing advancing and receding
swing magnet
answer dearest what's your final reading
<|endoftext|>

your forgiveness
to what would you confess
beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness
<|endoftext|>

doesn't want to touch
this tattooed body
sheltered in a solar cave
<|endoftext|>

or ask for something perhaps out of habit but as the past
must always be honored unconsciously formally and persists
on this first and singular day though i think of it as last
<|endoftext|>

well one of you falls asleep
and the other one does likewise with a lighted cigarette in his mouth
and that's how people burn to death in hotel rooms
<|endoftext|>

and a thousand insects outside called
and made me nothing
moonlight streamed inside as if it had been
<|endoftext|>

scene six: in front of an old and empty lot in contemporary athens a
crowd motley with priests and bishops gathers to cast a stone
the stone of anathema
<|endoftext|>

but when i try i know it's just another
instance of me whistling in the dark
me not blazing me not burning out
<|endoftext|>

to you born into violence
the wars of the red ant are nothing
you in the heart of the eruption
<|endoftext|>

i am speaking from immeasurable grass blades
you there on the rubble
what is the river of vapor to you
<|endoftext|>

to you the machine guns
to you the semen of fire
the birth of the maggot in the corpse
<|endoftext|>

you to whom we send these gifts
at the heart of light we are crushed together
when the sun dies we will become one
<|endoftext|>

so i could say mine
my own
and mean it
<|endoftext|>

and the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly
i noticed that today
one day more bursts them open fully
<|endoftext|>

even the swarms of kids have given in
to winter's big excuse boxed-in allure
tvs ricochet light behind pulled curtains
<|endoftext|>

the days throw up a closed sign around four
the hapless customer who'd wanted something
arrives to find lights out a bolted door
<|endoftext|>

not your moon who cares
she
remains unmoved your companion
<|endoftext|>

this is the wind out of which i bring clouds
these are my hands that gnarled though they be
when lifted to the sky bring rain
<|endoftext|>

on the record oh baby oh measure
oh strange balance that grips us
on this side of the world
<|endoftext|>

i charley horse and miracle ride
your absence
the whipped froth of the ocean
<|endoftext|>

the map must be of sand and can't be read by ordinary light
it
must carry fire to the next tribal town for renewal of spirit
<|endoftext|>

take note of the proliferation of supermarkets and malls the
altars of money
they best describe the detour from grace
<|endoftext|>

flowers of rage spring up in the depression
monsters are born
there of nuclear anger
<|endoftext|>

you will travel through the membrane of death smell cooking
from the encampment where our relatives make a feast of fresh
deer meat and corn soup in the milky way
<|endoftext|>

what our betrayals were we know
with a knowledge intimate beyond revenge
history the needle's eye you can't squeeze through
<|endoftext|>

the partisans cut us down heaped us
in a mass grave our relatives dug up: yes
there were tears even for us
<|endoftext|>

now like aliens from space on your tv shows
we ravel into mist surrounding
you the moment your eyes close
<|endoftext|>

or the plum tree
as in the pulse
that forms these lines
<|endoftext|>

wait till easter to grow
then they come up even with snow still on the ground
i thought i'd seen that happen
<|endoftext|>

one dome of air and fire
but he was not there
nor i here
<|endoftext|>

hairy muscular suburban
wearing chocolate double-breasted suits
they blew their tops and beat him black and blue
<|endoftext|>

in love if love be love if love be ours
faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers
unfaith in aught is want of faith in all
<|endoftext|>

it is the little rift within the lute
that by and by will make the music mute
and ever widening slowly silence all
<|endoftext|>

the little rift within the lover's lute
or little pitted speck in garner'd fruit
that rotting inward slowly moulders all
<|endoftext|>

how warm a wind blew here about the ways
and shadows on the hillside lay to slumber
during the long sun-sweetened summer-days
<|endoftext|>

the swallows veering skimmed the golden grain
at midday with a wing aslant and limber
and yellow cattle browsed upon the plain
<|endoftext|>

i had a sister lovely in my sight
her hair was dark her eyes were very sombre
we sang together in the woods at night
<|endoftext|>

the babble of our children fills my ears
and on our hearth i stare the perished ember
to flames that show all starry thro' my tears
<|endoftext|>

but that i knew these places are my own
i'd ask how came such wretchedness to cumber
the earth and i to people it alone
<|endoftext|>

by the time they force an entry
he'll have skedaddled
among hen runs and pigeon lofts
<|endoftext|>

he has turned over a
new leaf in her ladyship's herb patch
they'll take it back for analysis
<|endoftext|>

red strokes
sugar sweet
widows whelps
<|endoftext|>

indigenous
he teased
as he flew by
<|endoftext|>

so in my bed
that curtain'd grave though sleep like ashes hide
my lamp and life both shall in thee abide
<|endoftext|>

it is by falling in and in we make
the all-bearing point for one another's sake
in faultless failing raised by our own weight
<|endoftext|>

listen it's time
you were chosen too
to put the world together
<|endoftext|>

he scrambled up my science notes
with eggs and bacon strips
and baked potato chips
<|endoftext|>

only cinder our scottie puppy
paralyzed from gobbling toads
i sat mixing black earth and lime
<|endoftext|>

a fluff of the west wind puffing
my blouse kiting me over our seven chimneys
troubling the waters
<|endoftext|>

the finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts
being bushwhacked on the veldt
they were almost life-size
<|endoftext|>

my hands were warm then cool on the piles
of earth and lime
a black pile and a white pile
<|endoftext|>

i'm trying to string together three words
which i hate more than i hate myself
gobsmacked hubby and
<|endoftext|>

hickey i'd say sit down pull up set to
here's knife and fork there's wine and there's a barmaid
let us submerge ourselves in onion-soup
<|endoftext|>

we stood by a pond that winter day
and the sun was white as though chidden of god
and a few leaves lay on the starving sod
<|endoftext|>

each and every moment's a shortcut
i follow it through the meaning of the east
returning home closing death's door
<|endoftext|>

like schoolkids asking: why do birds fly south
what time is it when an elephant sits on the fence
what's big red and eats rocks
<|endoftext|>

in you ruby
the pain
you wake to is not yours
<|endoftext|>

you are the one
solid the spaces lean on envious
you are the baby in the barn
<|endoftext|>

blood-drop lung of fire setting past
the sea bell and wave why am i separate
from that giant burrowing into further life
<|endoftext|>

we make it human and we call it love
this wintering is my own and not the world's
although the world is wintering
<|endoftext|>

i must stop my stopping and start to start
i can end at the beginning or begin at the end
i feel older younger both at once
<|endoftext|>

on a branch
floating downriver
a cricket singing
<|endoftext|>

i am especially open to sadness and hilarity
since my father died as a child
one week ago in this his ninetieth year
<|endoftext|>

we thought we saw the banners then
that shook along the walls
were gazing on the stalls
<|endoftext|>

the art of losing isn't hard to master
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster
<|endoftext|>

o night
do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers
what is that little black thing i see there in the white
<|endoftext|>

high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves
surely you must know who is here is here
you must know who i am my love
<|endoftext|>

o darkness
o in vain
o i am very sick and sorrowful
<|endoftext|>

but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us
as for an hour carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse forever
every day at sundown for your dear sake my love
<|endoftext|>

nothing again will ever be this easy lives
being snatched up like dropped stitches the dry stalks of daylilies
marking a stillness we can't keep
<|endoftext|>

and the rabbit ignorant of mercy
curled on itself in that white drift
of feathers
<|endoftext|>

they tossed him the portrait from the tallest of the buildings
and the sea devoured the canvas and the brush
as though his subject had decided to remain a prayer
<|endoftext|>

all must learn
reality is always sterner
than pleasures of the nighttime burner
<|endoftext|>

something real
like a bell
inside the golden seahorse gift shop
<|endoftext|>

when others run to windows or out of doors
to catch the sunset whole he is content
with any segment anywhere he sits
<|endoftext|>

from segment fragment he can reconstruct
the whole prefers to reconstruct the whole
as if to say i see more seeing less
<|endoftext|>

for well they knew the parters in all evenings
druid and roman and the rocked phoenician
the blood flows one imposed way and no other
<|endoftext|>

over and over for those
lolling and snoozing in the stroller
preparing to come after
<|endoftext|>

tall house standing on its high green hill
children do you remember
lawns slant down to a stream
<|endoftext|>

twig to twig the blooms bursting through the runnels that
held them
five runnels made in the foil by five fingers
<|endoftext|>

so seemly a seed could not die in vain
that sprig nor spice there would be none
of that precious pearl without a stain
<|endoftext|>

such odors eddied in my brain
to sudden slumber i was brought
by that precious pearl without a stain
<|endoftext|>

we chase chickens or dogs away from it
babies teethe at the corners
they scrape their knees under it
<|endoftext|>

wars have begun and ended at this table
it is a place to hide in the shadow of terror
a place to celebrate the terrible victory
<|endoftext|>

at this table we sing with joy with sorrow
we pray of suffering and remorse
we give thanks
<|endoftext|>

nodded beard-splitter to sorrowful
no power or possessions where my rule is
i will make you mine
<|endoftext|>

the ball our side will
be up and i will have to bat
and i might strike out
<|endoftext|>

passing the american graveyard for my birthday
the crosses stuttering white on tropical green
the years' quick focus of faces i do not remember
<|endoftext|>

the palm trees stalking like deliberate giants
for my birthday and all the hot adolescent memories
seen through a screen of water
<|endoftext|>

hail amp farewell
hail amp farewell
hail amp farewell
<|endoftext|>

nothing
his body states
is safe from the dance of ideas
<|endoftext|>

take the advice of a father who knows
you cannot begin too young
not to be a poet
<|endoftext|>

if i am not
with you when you die
that is just
<|endoftext|>

as the stone is unveiled
she weeps holding on
to the pillars
<|endoftext|>

you'd stroke my hair or hip
all our years the same flip
crack i do too
<|endoftext|>

a respite from disquietude and care
but that left only the lovely story
of a bright presence hanging in the air
<|endoftext|>

a) the body and the material things of the world are the key to any
knowledge we can possess
b) knowledge is only possible by means of the mind or psyche
<|endoftext|>

a) work is the potential source of the greatest human fulfillment
b) liberation from work should be the goal of any movement for
social improvement
<|endoftext|>

the ladder leans into its darkness
the anvil leans into its silence
the cup sits empty
<|endoftext|>

at first she thought the lump in the road
was clay thrown up by a trucker's wheel
then beatrice saw the mess of feathers
<|endoftext|>

and when once in your life you make the big trip to the original
chances are you'll mainly see your own face in the glass that protects
everything of which there's one only in the form of its only maker
<|endoftext|>

the same fierce angle the same penetration
i need to think again how deep the woods run
i need to weigh the cost of staying home
<|endoftext|>

outside white buildings yellow in the sun
outside the birds circle continuously
where trees are actual and take no holiday
<|endoftext|>

she's just cardboard clogging the landfill
her mother precious jade purse
has been regifted
<|endoftext|>

each day a new caption on the cartoon
ending that simply cannot be
one hears repeatedly the role of elegy is
<|endoftext|>

grates like a wet match
from the broccoli patch
flares and all over town begins to catch
<|endoftext|>

each one an active
displacement in perspective
each screaming this is where i live
<|endoftext|>

the crown of red
set on your little head
is charged with all your fighting blood
<|endoftext|>

yes that excrescence
makes a most virile presence
plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence
<|endoftext|>

all the assembly
that deny deny deny
is not all the roosters cry
<|endoftext|>

the sun climbs in
following to see the end
faithful as enemy or friend
<|endoftext|>

the thing to do is keep a straight face which is hard
after all you're
supposed to be crazy
<|endoftext|>

oh the loops and unloops
destiny unfolds in my knees
i eat breakfast to begin the day
<|endoftext|>

who find themselves so very well
when gazing in that kiddie pool or any
skinny inch of water
<|endoftext|>

then god the mother said to jim in a dream
never mind you jim
come rest again on the country porch of my knees
<|endoftext|>

groping back to bed after a piss
i part thick curtains and am startled by
the rapid clouds the moon's cleanliness
<|endoftext|>

is a reminder of the strength and pain
of being young that it can't come again
but is for others undiminished somewhere
<|endoftext|>

your nurse could only speak italian
but after twenty minutes i could imagine your final week
and tears ran down my cheeks
<|endoftext|>

coming undone something terribly
nimble-fingered
finding all of the stops
<|endoftext|>

sunlight touches our faces
turning us turning us turning us
in our morning sleep
<|endoftext|>

i said sister pack the trunks
you hurt me
i will write that we have departed for france for italy
<|endoftext|>

art that's opera or repertory
the desert song
nancy was in the chorus
<|endoftext|>

but to ask for twelve pounds a week
married aren't you
you've got a nerve
<|endoftext|>

how could i look a bus conductor
in the face
if i paid you twelve pounds
<|endoftext|>

who says it's poetry anyhow
my ten year old
can do it and rhyme
<|endoftext|>

i get three thousand and expenses
a car vouchers
but i'm an accountant
<|endoftext|>

they do what i tell them
my company
what do you do
<|endoftext|>

nasty little words nasty long words
it's unhealthy
i want to wash when i meet a poet
<|endoftext|>

they're reds addicts
all delinquents
what you write is rot
<|endoftext|>

mr hines says so and he's a schoolteacher
he ought to know
go and find work
<|endoftext|>

today in a german dictionary i saw elend
and the heart in my breast turned over it was
it was a word one translates wretched
<|endoftext|>

who in the spring from the new sun
already has a fever got
too late begins those shafts to shun
<|endoftext|>

subway floods and late for audition
start being the author of your own performance
take a walk
<|endoftext|>

sorrow is my corner store
where jack-o'-lantern balloons
get high on the last helium
<|endoftext|>

the endcap is gold today
with numbered bags
of werther's original
<|endoftext|>

last night a newscaster
mentioned an elderly victim
don't call me that
<|endoftext|>

morning of crystal
this is the deathless body and this
the land's blood
<|endoftext|>

how dark soe'er the hills throw out their shade
under her summer green the beautiful lady
covers it like a stone cover'd in grass
<|endoftext|>

he comes out mildly
attentive soft accent possibly a scottish
childhood possibly sheep to tend
<|endoftext|>

( a man told me i better think
oh dear
i better
<|endoftext|>

and then another
as if he were helping them up
to enter a streetcar and not eternity
<|endoftext|>

the light from the stars makes the shadow equal to the body
light from fire makes it greater
there under the tongue there under the utterance
<|endoftext|>

for when the knife has slit
the throat across from ear to ear
'twill bleed because of it
<|endoftext|>

and she lived unguarded curiously
by no one that she really knew
held very dear
<|endoftext|>

seamus
they once read my letters at a roadblock
and shone their torches on your hieroglyphics
<|endoftext|>

ulster was british but with no rights on
the english lyric: all around us though
we hadn't named it the ministry of fear
<|endoftext|>

shall i tell you the secret
and if i do will you get me
out of this bird suit
<|endoftext|>

old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
<|endoftext|>

said old floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
<|endoftext|>

poor floyd ireson for his hard heart
tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
by the women of marblehead
<|endoftext|>

i roamed the field
angry amp burned
asking bitter questions of a gun
<|endoftext|>

dance is a body's refusal
to die
but oh your gone hair
<|endoftext|>

but not my brand
not at all
and
<|endoftext|>

and on the edge a blackbird
trying over and over its broken line
trying over and over its broken line
<|endoftext|>

i had the pig under my arm
he was bleeding on my foot  i said
midget i got friends on that river
<|endoftext|>

so when i look at the sky i see the past
yes yes he said
especially on a clear day
<|endoftext|>

seven miles away
and you know the flowers
of the saguaros bloom only at night
<|endoftext|>

all master narratives of the mind in a rowboat and the rowboat as beautiful as the swamp
glowing the dungeon-state lily pads unfolding like riddles of water the plasticine
heads of amphibians speckled skin of religious fervor and the razor-blade weeds
<|endoftext|>

beneath a dove and rainbow
some bank their fire
wrap their erogenous zones in barbed wire
<|endoftext|>

and the apple and the hill
and we'll puff cigars from noon till night
as if we were alive
<|endoftext|>

thus safe ashore
i ask no more
my all is in my possession
<|endoftext|>

hand trembling towards hand the amazing lights
of heart and eye
they stood on supreme heights
<|endoftext|>

but digging now i feel an otherness
life a great inhuman freedom
here i work a plot that also grounds
<|endoftext|>

but then his mother's sweets you so apply
her joys her smiles her loves as readers take
for venus' ceston every line you make
<|endoftext|>

wake up
it's the middle of the night
you can either make love or die at the hands of the cobra commander
<|endoftext|>

first time he kissed me he but only kissed
the fingers of this hand wherewith i write
and ever since it grew more clean and white
<|endoftext|>

like they say four times up
three times down
i'm still on the mountain
<|endoftext|>

meanwhile my muse right humbly doth beseech
that my good lord accept this vent'rous verse
until my brains may better stuff devise
<|endoftext|>

if a man was never to lie to me
never lie me
i swear i would never leave him
<|endoftext|>

hunger angst: the blue shimmer of emotion water speeding
through a canyon to see only to know: to wake finding
a lug nut ticket stub string personal card ink smear
<|endoftext|>

of us
my life belongs to the world
i will do what i can
<|endoftext|>

so that everyone has his own
private piece to kill
will we do it
<|endoftext|>

the dancers come dressed like rainbows
and linking hands they turn
to the melancholy fiddles
<|endoftext|>

inamoratas with an approbation
bestowed his title
blessed his inclination
<|endoftext|>

he waits a moment he designs his reign
that no performance may be plain or vain
then rises in a clear delirium
<|endoftext|>

he sheds with his pajamas shabby days
and his desertedness his intricate fear the
postponed resentments and the prim precautions
<|endoftext|>

here are hats
like bright umbrellas and hysterical ties
like narrow banners for some gathering war
<|endoftext|>

we'll raise the curtain fill the house start the engines
fly off into the sunrise the spire of the empire state
the last sight on the horizon as the earth begins to curve
<|endoftext|>

vainly she calls upon michael
for michael has fled from his tower
to the angel over the sea
<|endoftext|>

hanging his head between his knees
spent before he jerks himself up
and starts all over again
<|endoftext|>

i acknowledge there is no sweetness
that doesn't leave a stain
no sweetness that's ever sufficiently sweet
<|endoftext|>

where it's been or what bitter road
it's traveled
to come so far to taste so good
<|endoftext|>

their jousting ends in music much
as trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm
and is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees now day after day
<|endoftext|>

when they take their break they leave their brooms standing at attention in the asphalt pails
work gloves clinging like br'er rabbit to the bitten shafts and they slouch along the precipitous lip
the enormous sky behind them the heavy noontime air alive with shimmers and mirages
<|endoftext|>

that you are good
that you love them
that you would save them again
<|endoftext|>

so i was put on waivers right after camp
and here i am panty-sniffer about to die a clown
who once opened a hole you could drive nebraska through
<|endoftext|>

i said  is it true
we are sisters
they said  yes we are of one family
<|endoftext|>

odd comfort when the light goes the case lights left on
and the rings of baloney the herring the parsley
arranged in the strict familiar ways
<|endoftext|>

whatever intactness holds animals up
has been carefully taken what's left are the parts
just look in the cases all counted and stacked
<|endoftext|>

triumphant unaware we've left behind
this mop and mow mechanism
of silence to which we may never return
<|endoftext|>

you are he said
beautiful
that is not love she said rightly
<|endoftext|>

they clapped when they took off
for home despite the dead
dream they saw a free future
<|endoftext|>

she has your high clear polished forehead but
no my sister has his dimple the cleft
in his chin
<|endoftext|>

and she's embarrassed
you're embarrassed living in her blood
to think you ever acted like that
<|endoftext|>

circles the pyramid of cestius
crosses a graveyard and submerges
again like the fin of a shark
<|endoftext|>

on the men's hats
and now
the snow grows heavier falls on their stooping shoulders
<|endoftext|>

spruce inadequate and alien
i stood at the side of the road
it was the only life i had
<|endoftext|>

after all you know there are days
when even thirst runs dry
and prayer's lips harden
<|endoftext|>

toddling through shadows
sturdy wobbling
fragile pregnant as summer is
<|endoftext|>

i think he wanted to speak
but the dream had no sound
i think i must have loved him
<|endoftext|>

come i'll instruct thee
know the vestal fire
is not by marriage quenched but flames the higher
<|endoftext|>

no one
to witness
and adjust no one to drive the car
<|endoftext|>

without thy light what light remains in me
thou art my life my way my light's in thee
i live i move and by thy beams i see
<|endoftext|>

my light thou art-without thy glorious sight
my eyes are darken'd with eternal night
my love thou art my way my life my light
<|endoftext|>

thou art my way i wander if thou fly
thou art my light if hid how blind am i
thou art my life if thou withdraw'st i die
<|endoftext|>

if i have lost my path dear lover say
shall i still wander in a doubtful way
love shall a lamb of israel's sheepfold stray
<|endoftext|>

my path is lost my wandering steps do stray
i cannot go nor can i safely stay
whom should i seek but thee my path my way
<|endoftext|>

dissolve thy sunbeams close thy wings and stay
see see how i am blind and dead and stray
-o thou art my life my light my way
<|endoftext|>

i go again to the sea and converse with ovid
the poet whose lines of fortune and arteries my earth senses
when he raises the dobruja's broad hand to his brow
<|endoftext|>

we shall not loiter long your friends and i
living you made it goodlier to live
dead you will make it easier to die
<|endoftext|>

final proof he was not handicapped by his handicap
he married a deaf woman but his two daughters
are normal i mean not deaf
<|endoftext|>

my stomach contracted: oh god what have i done
it wasn't me asking discomfiting questions to hound
this dear sweet ebullient man who had done his best
<|endoftext|>

it's here
it's there
it hovers begging hand out
<|endoftext|>

and on a hot dry day july they could all but burn
at a certain age you try to pull all kinds of things
out of the ground out of the loose gravel thrown by trains

hey man i'll ask
haven't you heard of
the thirties
<|endoftext|>

the thirties
what's
that
<|endoftext|>

i got in the shower
and burned my balls
last wednesday
<|endoftext|>

they are subtle : they seem to float though they weigh me down
upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color
a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck
<|endoftext|>

when we spurred you against wellington's infantry squares
you side-ran them or reared back
the god of catasrophes took note
<|endoftext|>

muir knew you on both shores and van der post knew you
mufti lords recognizing a lord in service
nuzzle them both
<|endoftext|>

where you linger for shade on the veldt branches level
a tree is the only tree
your water the only water
<|endoftext|>

flickers of hair along your neck's crest release
the only signal
which staggers from storm cloud to browse oats
<|endoftext|>

for your standing here re-ordains neither akhilleus
nor cuchulain
dew braids your mane with fresh constellations
<|endoftext|>

for that demigod's eye tiding capsizes anyone
who would turn trainer
and this one goes on into the bond
<|endoftext|>

and the top tamers spook-soothers the whisperers
will write their books but miss the appointment
it is not inscribed
<|endoftext|>

the unreached-for cup beaker for world-toxin
breast englobing ground zero
and so we know you not
<|endoftext|>

evening the priest
let three rivers flow
and a woman sing to her child
<|endoftext|>

and such for all that i foreknow
may be the truth
the deeper woe
<|endoftext|>

how then o weary one
explain
the sources of that hidden pain
<|endoftext|>

ii
but now stand forth as sweet as life
and let me paint you as a wife
<|endoftext|>

ode to weakness whatever i am
the situation inside
the marriage
<|endoftext|>

dull and insensible couldst see
a thing so near a deity
move up and down and feel no change
<|endoftext|>

the woman her womb solid with the future
instructs her husband's eyes
to clutch insurance policies
<|endoftext|>

they ignore my love affair with the furniture
the corner table that memorized
my crossed-out lines
<|endoftext|>

was our greatest scribe well hilda gave us a few pink
grecian gods in with the chinaware but after reading her
i still have icicles hanging from my bones
<|endoftext|>

dear dead women with such hair too
we quote and notice that hair is the first
of ourselves to decay before last after death
<|endoftext|>

i can't
stand this which
one of us do you love
<|endoftext|>

above the roof a windfucker smacked
the air
and wind kept eating the island rocks
<|endoftext|>

abelard and eloise
henry the fowler charlemagne
die die in pain
<|endoftext|>

my curls about her neck did crawl
and arms and hands they did enthrall
so that she could not freely stir
<|endoftext|>

what business have i to do that
i know the world and i love it too much and it
is not the one i'd find outside this door
<|endoftext|>

to hold back chaos i transformed
amorphous mass and fire and cloud
and golden structures form
<|endoftext|>

the white peacock roosting
might have been christ
featherd robe of osiris
<|endoftext|>

and out of gratitude
we imagine immortality for them
snug as the burrow of a mouse
<|endoftext|>

and memory's wick
draws the liquefied
wax of experience up into flame
<|endoftext|>

strange how quiet they are with their presence
so humble in the low song they sing
not expecting that anyone will listen
<|endoftext|>

this
gives us
wings
<|endoftext|>

power
i was the son of a king
hacking the armor from the limbs of the dying
<|endoftext|>

the fire-flames crooned a tiny song
no cold wind stirred the wintry tree
beside their mother's knee
<|endoftext|>

meet you her my wishes
bespeak her to my blisses
and be ye call'd my absent kisses
<|endoftext|>

i wish her beauty
that owes not all his duty
to gaudy tire or glist'ring shoe-ty
<|endoftext|>

something more than
taffeta or tissue can
or rampant feather or rich fan
<|endoftext|>

more than the spoil
of shop or silkworm's toil
or a bought blush or a set smile
<|endoftext|>

a face that's best
by its own beauty drest
and can alone command the rest
<|endoftext|>

a face made up
out of no other shop
than what nature's white hand sets ope
<|endoftext|>

a cheek where youth
and blood with pen of truth
write what the reader sweetly ru'th
<|endoftext|>

a cheek where grows
more than a morning rose
which to no box his being owes
<|endoftext|>

lips where all day
a lover's kiss may play
yet carry nothing thence away
<|endoftext|>

looks that oppress
their richest tires but dress
and clothe their simplest nakedness
<|endoftext|>

eyes that displaces
the neighbour diamond and outfaces
that sunshine by their own sweet graces
<|endoftext|>

tresses that wear
jewels but to declare
how much themselves more precious are
<|endoftext|>

whose native ray
can tame the wanton day
of gems that in their bright shades play
<|endoftext|>

each ruby there
or pearl that dare appear
be its own blush be its own tear
<|endoftext|>

a well-tam'd heart
for whose more noble smart
love may be long choosing a dart
<|endoftext|>

eyes that bestow
full quivers on love's bow
yet pay less arrows than they owe
<|endoftext|>

smiles that can warm
the blood yet teach a charm
that chastity shall take no harm
<|endoftext|>

blushes that bin
the burnish of no sin
nor flames of aught too hot within
<|endoftext|>

joys that confess
virtue their mistress
and have no other head to dress
<|endoftext|>

fears fond and flight
as the coy bride's when night
first does the longing lover right
<|endoftext|>

tears quickly fled
and vain as those are shed
for a dying maidenhead
<|endoftext|>

days that need borrow
no part of their good morrow
from a forespent night of sorrow
<|endoftext|>

days that in spite
of darkness by the light
of a clear mind are day all night
<|endoftext|>

nights sweet as they
made short by lovers' play
yet long by th' absence of the day
<|endoftext|>

life that dares send
a challenge to his end
and when it comes say welcome friend
<|endoftext|>

sidneian showers
of sweet discourse whose powers
can crown old winter's head with flowers
<|endoftext|>

soft silken hours
open suns shady bowers
'bove all nothing within that lours
<|endoftext|>

whate'er delight
can make day's forehead bright
or give down to the wings of night
<|endoftext|>

in her whole frame
have nature all the name
art and ornament the shame
<|endoftext|>

her flattery
picture and poesy
her counsel her own virtue be
<|endoftext|>

i wish her store
of worth may leave her poor
of wishes and i wish no more
<|endoftext|>

'tis she and here
lo i unclothe and clear
my wishes' cloudy character
<|endoftext|>

may she enjoy it
whose merit dare apply it
but modesty dares still deny it
<|endoftext|>

such worth as this is
shall fix my flying wishes
and determine them to kisses
<|endoftext|>

let her full glory
my fancies fly before ye
be ye my fictions but her story
<|endoftext|>

nothing proved can be

delighted in the delighting
i love you in mid-air
i love myself the ground
<|endoftext|>

the great wings sing nothing
lightly
lightly fall
<|endoftext|>

solid the white walls
rising up out of the sea
the pillared crown of the temple
<|endoftext|>

the sky is full of children
with wild eyes and huge faces
falling to the ground
<|endoftext|>

it's been only me and the two telephones
the one on the wall in the kitchen
and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs
<|endoftext|>

i turn my back
and everyone i command
sees what it can be to be commanded
<|endoftext|>

phantom limbs spring is a verb
a wish is a wash a walking stick

i leave my love with you
i leave my love with you
in this strange city

cursed be he that confirmeth not
the words of this law to do them

into the interstices of a new

there was terror already
in her love even before
she knew for sure her lover was the god
<|endoftext|>

that the world can hear the sharp shout
which wakes the cat
her claws one inch from the rabbit's bobbing scut

we do not finally put it down: still till
the host appears we'll make the masters here

lamp-drawn moths before the six-limbed elders
arrive as one mind as shifting soil to polish
what's left forsaking only the inedible brain
<|endoftext|>

come slow
and look me again in the eyes
as you do
<|endoftext|>

and it is always your fault: not enough planning
the wrong color passport the misplaced stress
in a word
<|endoftext|>

as each child crawls out their gutted hole

we can never rest
<|endoftext|>

you go in the door
the pot lies upside down in the hearth
it sprawls with hostile black feet
<|endoftext|>

through her in a rush of musk
and saffron beauty falls
into disarray
<|endoftext|>

the last drop
of the fluid soul
before evaporation
<|endoftext|>

when rain inspires the night birds to create
rhyme and formal verse stanzas can be made
between abstract expression and first light
<|endoftext|>

her heartbeat is a metaphor a late
bloom of red flowers that refuse to fade
my darling turns to poetry at night
<|endoftext|>

he stumped up but crime befell kismet
pardon repelled mores

<|endoftext|>

of your mouth perfect as light
and the tree bends and stands upright
in the stolid night
<|endoftext|>

is the history of currents: a canal small enough
to catch a childhood in its net
water vast enough to divide a life
<|endoftext|>

can you show me how to wish
how to gather and scatter
this single hooped breath
<|endoftext|>

graceless creatures that we are unmake and befoul our beds
don't tell me deluge
don't tell me heat too damned much heat
<|endoftext|>

catalogue's tissuelike

things as they are and will be visible beneath it

the ants march on in rows
they're off to do who knows
what harm to the ripe pears
<|endoftext|>

where ancient glass trembles
facets of dark open to tumble out
king revenge-tragedy triumphal colors of god

no one can know
what is
between me and god

what you want

i see your hair
which i call red
i lie here in this bed
<|endoftext|>

even the earth claims color
once a year dressed in red leaves
as the trees play grieving
<|endoftext|>

the way the sun dissolves the snow's crust
the way in the wind that stirred the light leaves
the oracle that the sibyl wrote was lost
<|endoftext|>

things from me
along my fingertips bare shoots
of days then years unfurl in the cold air
<|endoftext|>

a small moon that's been hidden
under my pillow that's been changing
the way my body moves this whole time
<|endoftext|>

like the woman the magician levitates
over the table her body floating an unlikely
inch or two above the velvet-draped plateau
<|endoftext|>

red rocks blood clots bearing boys blood sands
swimming being from women's hands we originate
originally spontaneous as hemorrhage
<|endoftext|>

could be cousins left on the land bridge
contrary to popular belief that was a two-way toll
in any case we'd claim them give them some place to stay

some of us are like trees that grow with a spiral grain
as if prepared for the path of the spirit's journey
to the world of all souls
<|endoftext|>

it is not an easy path
a dog stands at the opening constellation
past the great helping hand
<|endoftext|>

the dog wants to know
did you ever harm an animal hurt any creature
did you take a life you didn't eat
<|endoftext|>

it is a world that can't be imagined by ordinary means
after this first one
the next could be a map of forever

my body laid out on a marble slab
naked but for a linen sheet tucked under
its chin as though to keep the patient warm
<|endoftext|>

a solemn band approached identified
the late departed with what looked like mingled
relief mild satisfaction and bereavement

sensing its mute but anchored trust that parts
lucky for others would befriend as well

departs and the world is taken by surprise
<|endoftext|>

when under the arches of the ponte vecchio
a green light enters against stream flush from the west
against the current of obscure arno
<|endoftext|>

part of the grass that answers the wind
part of the midnight's watchfulness that knows
there is no silence but when danger comes

would that love's fond pursuit
or that his virgin kiss
lasted for ever
<|endoftext|>

your eyes were never yet let in to see
the majesty and riches of the mind
but dwell in darkness for your god is blind
<|endoftext|>

the old mist again
blinds me as then it did
how vain
<|endoftext|>

my memory leaves
no least stamp out nor how anon
he pulled his ringing gauntlets on
<|endoftext|>

our elder boy has got the clear
great brow tho' when his brother's black
full eye shows scorn it
<|endoftext|>

i believe
it will rain
tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

i believe
the son of a bitch
is going into the river
<|endoftext|>

well he seemed so low that i couldn't say no then he says with a sort of moan
yet 'tain't being dead it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains
so i want you to swear that foul or fair you'll cremate my last remains
<|endoftext|>

to see
i'll wait beside you though
i don't know what we're waiting for
<|endoftext|>

cheers baby
here's to us
see how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back
<|endoftext|>

sweet opium and tea yo-ho
pennies for porpoises that bank the keel
fins whip the breeze around japan
<|endoftext|>

day of satan's painful duty
earth shall vanish hot and sooty
so says virtue so says beauty
<|endoftext|>

now the trumpet's invocation
calls the dead to condemnation
all receive an invitation
<|endoftext|>

death and nature now are quaking
and the late lamented waking
in their breezy shrouds are shaking
<|endoftext|>

when the judge appears in session
we shall all attend confession
loudly preaching non-suppression
<|endoftext|>

how shall i then make romances
mitigating circumstances
even the just must take their chances
<|endoftext|>

king whose majesty amazes
save thou him who sings thy praises
fountain quench my private blazes
<|endoftext|>

seeking me fatigue assailed thee
calvary's outlook naught availed thee
now 'twere cruel if i failed thee
<|endoftext|>

sighs of guilt my conscience gushes
and my face vermilion flushes
spare me for my pretty blushes
<|endoftext|>

thief and harlot when repenting
thou forgavest complimenting
me with sign of like relenting
<|endoftext|>

if too bold is my petition
i'll receive with due submission
my dismissal from perdition
<|endoftext|>

when thy sheep thou hast selected
from the goats may i respected
stand amongst them undetected
<|endoftext|>

when offenders are indited
and with trial-flames ignited
elsewhere i'll attend if cited
<|endoftext|>

ashen-hearted prone and prayerful
when of death i see the air full
lest i perish too be careful
<|endoftext|>

and they haunt the sleepless
i don't count
who cannot earn my keep
<|endoftext|>

hammering a dent out of a bucket
a woodpecker
answers from the woods
<|endoftext|>

but oh
what envious gods conspire
to snatch his pow'r yet leave him the desire
<|endoftext|>

the fishy deals and incestuous combinations
the husband and the wife of his wife's brother
the hospital contract the certificate
<|endoftext|>

he clasps the crag with crooked hands
close to the sun in lonely lands
ring'd with the azure world he stands
<|endoftext|>

the wrinkled sea beneath him crawls
he watches from his mountain walls
and like a thunderbolt he falls
<|endoftext|>

there is a spectacle and something is added to history
it has as its object an indiscretion: old age a
gun the prevention of sleep
<|endoftext|>

i am placed in its stead
and the requisite shadow is yours
it casts across me a violent coat
<|endoftext|>

it seems i fit into its sleeve
so the body wanders
sometime it goes where light does not reach
<|endoftext|>

the spectacle has been placed in my room
can you hear its episode trailing
pretending to be a thing with variegated wings
<|endoftext|>

do you know the name of this thing
it is a rubbing from an image
the subject of the image is that which trespasses
<|endoftext|>

take back the night
take killjoy's
cameras amp microphones to the streets
<|endoftext|>

effort for distraction grew
ferocious grew
ferocious and paced that was its exercise
<|endoftext|>

effort for distraction strained
legged in the hour-like single stretch
its heels and sight to feel so slit its eyes
<|endoftext|>

by all the traction of mind and spin of spirit
having gained grasp gasped to bear it
having got ground groaned furious title holder
<|endoftext|>

paced and cried so sore for a different direction grew
ferocious grew
unkind to strength that gave it strength to grow
<|endoftext|>

every threshold is sacred
the eternal allure
of what comes next
<|endoftext|>

no farther seek his merits to disclose
or draw his frailties from their dread abode
the bosom of his father and his god
<|endoftext|>

o death all-eloquent
you only prove
what dust we dote on when 'tis man we love
<|endoftext|>

it is the end of an ethnic dream
my bass a fine piece of furniture
my brain blistered
<|endoftext|>

ev'n in an ornament its place remark
nor in an hermitage set dr
clarke
<|endoftext|>

that's out in montana the bitterroot valley
long ways from home is how they say it
long ways from home boys long long ways from home
<|endoftext|>

might as well not put this clunker in the shop
and keep my hard-earned in my pocket
she wobbles and humps like a scared rabbit
<|endoftext|>

that's one thing though that heart of darkness
i read that story every year i never forget
that crazy old son-of-a-bitch that kurtz
<|endoftext|>

and the next thing i see about a quarter-mile
down the road is somebody small on the shoulder
a kid looking for a ride home i figure
<|endoftext|>

and he's a kid all right maybe ten or eleven
but no montana boy he's an oriental
one of those laotians that got resettled
<|endoftext|>

the light swallowed itself a balloon
deflating somewhere in the darkness
a murmuring let itself go
<|endoftext|>

flying mangoes perhaps
flying mango-tomato hybrids
beautiful sons
<|endoftext|>

with a thousand faces
none perfect a thousand tongues all broken
a thousand hands all with scratching nails
<|endoftext|>

planted coffee the better part of the day eight plants
in the nursery three times that many
planted coffee
<|endoftext|>

see the grisly texture grow
and the weights that play below
each a gasping warrior's head
<|endoftext|>

let us go and let us fly
where our friends the conflict share
where they triumph where they die
<|endoftext|>

we the reins to slaughter give
ours to kill and ours to spare
spite of danger he shall live
<|endoftext|>

the sky an empty karate studio the sky route
because she saw herself everywhere
the sky a fugue the folds of a gown where the dragons are
<|endoftext|>

there could be no other
a film was her darling
the sky artists' supplies the sky six-thirty darkening
<|endoftext|>

i take myself to the movies the romance of sheets
the dustup of things and her magnificent face: stylish
the sky inside her eyes chlorine and glass
<|endoftext|>

the sky orchestra and karma the sky gold bought and sold
the windows of the house i won't live in held light
and the island fires on the river held hawk and heron
<|endoftext|>

a smell familiar and far away unlocked by thaw
feral and essential like a language lost like night
illuminated by the night
<|endoftext|>

they make the straw for beds
they ask the caring hand to sow the resting foot
to stay to court the seasons
<|endoftext|>

like the moon
released at last and speechless
he has lost his descendants
<|endoftext|>

life splits
a rift a cleft the half
light between waking and sleeping
<|endoftext|>

a quartz-colored dawn rescues him
the day clears
dizzy waves rush to shore
<|endoftext|>

others he saves but could not save himself
socrates galen hippocrates the spirit
fastened by love upon the human cross
<|endoftext|>

the person may turn away as an act of mercy
leaving her there in a room full of understanding
with nothing to cover her neither sound nor silence
<|endoftext|>

truth
a pebble of quartz
for once then something
<|endoftext|>

there is the world dimensional for
those untwisted by the love of things
irreconcilable
<|endoftext|>

and the weather bum hips and cholesterol
our small talk numbing as a dial tone
serious as prayer
<|endoftext|>

for me i think i speak as i was taught
i always see the garden and god there
a-making man's wifei always see the garden and god there
<|endoftext|>

wife see genesis :-: and my lesson learned
the value and significance of flesh
i can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards
<|endoftext|>

bear witness for me wheresoe'er ye be
with what deep worship i have still adored
the spirit of divinest liberty
<|endoftext|>

and conquering by her happiness alone
shall france compel the nations to be free
till love and joy look round and call the earth their own
<|endoftext|>

the dim boy claps because the others clap
the polite word handicapped is muttered in the stands
isn't it wrong the way the mind moves back
<|endoftext|>

score  to pitcher fading badly in the heat
isn't it wrong to be or not be spastic
isn't it wrong the way the mind moves back
<|endoftext|>

i'm laughing at a neighbor girl beaten to scream
by a savage father and i'm ashamed to look
the dim boy claps because the others clap
<|endoftext|>

the score is always close the rally always short
i've left more wreckage than a quake
isn't it wrong the way the mind moves back
<|endoftext|>

that never will those on its breast
see an ennobling sight
drink of the feeling of quiet again
<|endoftext|>

who are you reader reading my poems an hundred years hence
i cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring one single streak of gold from yonder clouds
open your doors and look abroad
<|endoftext|>

god's angels again are for satan
forlorn
salvation was bought but sin sold in real time
<|endoftext|>

when i reach inside i am frosted
my hand like a pond in winter pale
fingers below of leaves or carp
<|endoftext|>

after it fed the two halves joined
the missing ones unmourned
all as it was before
<|endoftext|>

dead and dark for a long time
we are as stars to them
stars wishing to be wished on
<|endoftext|>

all the fun wonderful
sandy sunny things we do
at summerhouse time
<|endoftext|>

guess who really stole
mrs
bagwell's ring
<|endoftext|>

guess what mrs
bagwell
is doing now
<|endoftext|>

i hold my hand up
whoa
one guess at a time please
<|endoftext|>

and every night who knows (a laughter
troubles us like dreams) who skates
above peering through the pane
<|endoftext|>

her body witness is so also is her voice
of torment coming from unknown event
unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment
<|endoftext|>

a life is waiting
its webbed hand
reached out
<|endoftext|>

fate has written a tragedy its name is the human heart
the theatre is the house of life woman the mummer's part
the devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start
<|endoftext|>

but i lie down
to a different turbulence
and a plan of transformation
<|endoftext|>

somewhere some angel pities me as god
must once have pitied her: her voice forgets
its tenement and i neglect the words
<|endoftext|>

will his strength slay thy worm in hell
go to
cover thy countenance and watch and fear
<|endoftext|>

they are all gone away
the house is shut and still
there is nothing more to say
<|endoftext|>

through broken walls and gray
the winds blow bleak and shrill
they are all gone away
<|endoftext|>

nor is there one to-day
to speak them good or ill
there is nothing more to say
<|endoftext|>

iv
these fought in any case
and some believing pro domo in any case
<|endoftext|>

the thin clear gaze the same
still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face
questing and passive
<|endoftext|>

but that's also
the kind of book
i like best
<|endoftext|>

indistinguishable inasmuch as they
are countless sire
all the unglittering other dropped stones
<|endoftext|>

with what frivolity we have pared them
like toenails clipped them like ends of
split hair
<|endoftext|>

i stand high in the community
my name is in who's who
people argue about my modesty
<|endoftext|>

i am of the race of the prematurely desperate
in poverty of comfort i lay gunpowder plots
i lapse my insurance
<|endoftext|>

i am the babbitt metal of the future
i never read more than half of a book
but that half i read forever
<|endoftext|>

i take my place beside the philistine and unfold my napkin
this afternoon i defend the marines
i goggle at long cars
<|endoftext|>

the homosexual lectures me brilliantly in the beer booth
i can feel my muscles soften
he smiles at my terror
<|endoftext|>

pitchpots flicker in the lemon groves
i gaze down on the plains of hollywood
my fine tan and my arrogance my gray hair and my sneakers o israel
<|endoftext|>

everything i need
is
in it
<|endoftext|>

turn turn thy wheel above the staring crowd
thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud
thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate
<|endoftext|>

if not for the cat
and the scarcity of cheese
i could be content
<|endoftext|>

before i go let me thank the man who mugs you
taking your last paycheck thank the boss who steals
your tips thank the women who may break you
<|endoftext|>

but in the darkness and the cloud
while israel made their gods of gold
altho' the trumpet blew so loud
<|endoftext|>

at the end of the story
when the plague has arrived
the performance can begin
<|endoftext|>

and nobody would commit suicide only
to find beyond death
bridgeport ohio
<|endoftext|>

that soft lost near and distant voice
i'm happy now i'm happy oh don't
move don't go away
<|endoftext|>

peer at your ceiling
where a light dangles hook amp line
could be slipping through
<|endoftext|>

behind me did they stretch in solemn train
feebler and feebler and i stood and watched
till all was tranquil as a summer sea
<|endoftext|>

flirt fattened thursday of december's gorge
the twelve pigs of the zodiac stew the zeal
slow simmering giddy fizzling squeals
<|endoftext|>

h: i have trouble with no amp know
with knew amp new too
why do people do that
<|endoftext|>

h: see you make it hard for a house
anyway i don't
usually speak
<|endoftext|>

h: i'd like to climb mountains
you can leave me
whenever you want but i'm stuck with you
<|endoftext|>

h: none of your business
the sex life of houses isn't
known to humans nor will it ever be
<|endoftext|>

yo-ho-ho would say the sailors
for six days
while on the shore their women moaned
<|endoftext|>

they left not footsteps trails in uncut grass
like parallel snakes
no wonder
<|endoftext|>

and everywhere sharp palmettos
clacked their tongues in homage to language
i should have rhymed them with stilettos
<|endoftext|>

i'm fourteen
i'm a wind from nowhere
i can break your heart
<|endoftext|>

and this feels painfully beautiful
whether or not
it will change the world one drop
<|endoftext|>

or of its end
cries the child
hiding himself in the cushions
<|endoftext|>

when he awakened
she was just returning from
one of her little trips
<|endoftext|>

thus in a department store
petite impressions might neighbor
town square
<|endoftext|>

that tree makes their own torsion
seem natural
and so they're comforted
<|endoftext|>

for compared to my grief for you what are those of kashmir
and what are the griefs of the universe
when i remember you beyond all accounting o my mother
<|endoftext|>

domino gloria
don john of austria
is shouting to the ships
<|endoftext|>

domino gloria
don john of austria
has set his people free
<|endoftext|>

the waking dream's intact
the world continues not to change
and staying the same changes us
<|endoftext|>

ugliest little boy
that everyone ever saw
that is what everyone said
<|endoftext|>

don't touch me
cried the little
fairy-like being in the playground
<|endoftext|>

to celebrate the joyous day
when we regained the right to pray
to our one god in our own way
<|endoftext|>

oh i have the sense of infinity
but the world sailors is round
they say there is no end to it
<|endoftext|>

drest as though bold robin hood
would with his maid marian
sup and bowse from horn and can
<|endoftext|>

we live in wonder
blaze in a cycle of passion and apprehension
though once we lay and waited for a death
<|endoftext|>

saw in the lake's heaped frozen
waves a new car
exhibition restaurant luxury housing
<|endoftext|>

my ghost is trying its weight
on stepping stones look it's peeling off
weaned into the asphalt river
<|endoftext|>

would to god they did so still
then i'd 'scape the heat and racket
of the good ship lisbon packet
<|endoftext|>

nothing rhymes in english with an orange
it stands alone with luster in a far tinge
it stands alone and seems to make a star cringe
<|endoftext|>

on saturday it's blue like an orange
or like a surrealist sight rhyme in a garage
nothing rhymes in english with an orange
<|endoftext|>

but rime riche is rich enough for an orange
still my doorman sings put it away in storage
it stands alone and seems to make a star cringe
<|endoftext|>

orange replies: i'm drunk from my last bar-binge
half-rhymes like hangovers suddenly impinge
but nothing rhymes in english with an orange
<|endoftext|>

while my wife in french eats one in her nude linge
playwrights synge and inge flap forward on a car-hinge
it stands alone and seems to make a star cringe
<|endoftext|>

hue of concrete into each limb
a house of blue-ring flames
to mimic someone better run
<|endoftext|>

is it well to wish thee happy
having known me to decline
on a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine
<|endoftext|>

what is this
his eyes are heavy think not they are glazed with wine
go to him it is thy duty kiss him take his hand in thine
<|endoftext|>

well 't is well that i should bluster
hadst thou less unworthy proved
would to god for i had loved thee more than ever wife was loved
<|endoftext|>

where is comfort
in division of the records of the mind
can i part her from herself and love her as i knew her kind
<|endoftext|>

overlive it lower yet be happy
wherefore should i care
i myself must mix with action lest i wither by despair
<|endoftext|>

can i but relive in sadness
i will turn that earlier page
hide me from my deep emotion o thou wondrous mother-age
<|endoftext|>

not in vain the distance beacons
forward forward let us range
let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change
<|endoftext|>

that plastic preserve dorsal
fin tremulous snap and
of brine shrimp's gone
<|endoftext|>

the quiet
next time won't you sing with me
those great diminished chords: a girl i know
<|endoftext|>

i struggled to tell things back from decades gone
the mournful american soldier testifying
about my lai: i shot the older lady
<|endoftext|>

and the innocuous-looking cottage
in the woods with its lapping tongue
of a welcome mat slurped me in
<|endoftext|>

that placed you in that world
and me in this or that misfortune
placed these worlds in us
<|endoftext|>

shall i say i have gone at dusk through narrow streets
and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
of lonely men in shirt-sleeves leaning out of windows
<|endoftext|>

and the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully
smoothed by long fingers
asleep
<|endoftext|>

she is large and matronly
and rather dirty
a little sardonic-looking as if domesticity had driven her to it
<|endoftext|>

though what she does except lay four eggs at random in the garden once a year
and put up with her husband
i don't know
<|endoftext|>

he is much smaller
dapper beside her
and ridiculously small
<|endoftext|>

poor little earthy house-inhabiting osiris
the mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into pieces
and he must struggle after reconstruction ignominiously
<|endoftext|>

while i i pity monsieur
he pesters her and torments her said the woman
how much more is he pestered and tormented say i
<|endoftext|>

this face had no use for light took none of it
grew cavernous against stars bore into noon
a dark of midnight by its own resources
<|endoftext|>

yet where it lay in sleep where the pillows held it
with the blind plaster over it and the four walls
keeping the night carefully it was undone
<|endoftext|>

sixty-watt light squared to a window frame
across a well of air across wind and window
leaped and made shine the dark face in its sleep
<|endoftext|>

stretched into dusky lands
like a dark and silent companion
evening held out her hands
<|endoftext|>

why they are always standing in a semicircle
with their arms folded their bare legs set apart
their breasts protected by hard metal disks
<|endoftext|>

the man who married magdalene
had not forgiven her
god might pardon every sin
<|endoftext|>

i peer into each and see a faceless
red center red spokes like a star
they are and are not like what we are
<|endoftext|>

the cloud of mortal destiny
others will front it fearlessly
but who like him will put it by
<|endoftext|>

he will not go behind his father's saying
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again good fences make good neighbours
<|endoftext|>

like sculptured effigies they might be seen
upon their marriage-tomb the sword between
each wishing for the sword that severs all
<|endoftext|>

perchance my heart may pardon you this deed
but be no coward: you that made love bleed
you must bear all the venom of his tooth
<|endoftext|>

and one foolish man
climbs up his death high
in his elliptic face
<|endoftext|>

caught in the car's closed door beating its whole bird
body against it
trying it appeared to bang himself free
<|endoftext|>

and who knows how long he'd been there wailing
who
knows  he and the other i mistook at first for a bat
<|endoftext|>

the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died
i think
his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip
<|endoftext|>

i think his name was sonny runs out from his duplex
to pull my father off
you see where i'm going with this
<|endoftext|>

nose and mouth each time he comes up for air
imagine
the birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm
<|endoftext|>

moral
if you were born to walk the ground
remain there do not fool around
<|endoftext|>

what do you stand on such high legs for
why this length of shredded shank
you exaltation
<|endoftext|>

is it so that you shall lift your centre of gravity upwards
and weigh no more than air as you alight upon me
stand upon me weightless you phantom
<|endoftext|>

i heard a woman call you the winged victory
in sluggish venice
you turn your head towards your tail and smile
<|endoftext|>

how can you put so much devilry
into that translucent phantom shred
of a frail corpus
<|endoftext|>

queer with your thin wings and your streaming legs
how you sail like a heron or a dull clot of air
a nothingness
<|endoftext|>

settle and stand on long thin shanks
eyeing me sideways and cunningly conscious that i am aware
you speck
<|endoftext|>

come then let us play at unawares
and see who wins in this sly game of bluff
man or mosquito
<|endoftext|>

if that is so then i believe a little in providence protecting the innocent
but it sounds so amazingly like a slogan
a yell of triumph as you snatch my scalp
<|endoftext|>

blood red blood
super-magical
forbidden liquor
<|endoftext|>

such silence such suspended transport
such gorging
such obscenity of trespass
<|endoftext|>

queer what a big stain my sucked blood makes
beside the infinitesimal faint smear of you
queer what a dim dark smudge you have disappeared into
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
your hair the hue of rain-drenched bark your voice
don't ever leave me
<|endoftext|>

under the sun it glowed
under the moon
more glowing
<|endoftext|>

there's no one tosses them about
but mr
nobody
<|endoftext|>

rose leaves when the rose is dead
and so thy thoughts when thou art gone
love itself shall slumber on
<|endoftext|>

a mass of moth-eaten cloud
threadbare and spun across
a bullish moon
<|endoftext|>

when something drops onto her toes one night
she calls it a fox
but she feeds it
<|endoftext|>

thus wasted joys will show their early bloom
yet crumble at the breath of a caress
snatch it thou scatterest wide its emptiness
<|endoftext|>

chide not it was not vanity nor sense
but nature cadencing her joy of strength
to the harmonious limits of her right
<|endoftext|>

just as you're having what you wanted most
you want it more and more until that's more
than you or it or both of you can bear
<|endoftext|>

as they would flail crops
when the spring comes and flood and tassels
rise as my head
<|endoftext|>

flamingos
and now
the moon pressing back through the tree-line
<|endoftext|>

take not the name in vain
direct
thy swearing unto some effect
<|endoftext|>

kiss not thy neighbor's wife
of course
there's no objection to divorce
<|endoftext|>

bear not false witness
shake your head
and say that you have heard it said
<|endoftext|>

the sorrow on her face
is sealed: the living flesh is turned to stone
she knows all all that life and time can tell
<|endoftext|>

they linger awhile in the dazzling sepulchral city
delicately exploring their romantic diseases
the gangster the capitalist and their proteg
<|endoftext|>

in predawn dark a rat falling from a rafter is a dollop
wind a whir and suddenly i'm remembering my mother
teaching me to bake her hot water sponge cake
<|endoftext|>

with the shocked amp seeded
sweetness of an apple
split open by a meat cleaver
<|endoftext|>

oh no no no it was too cold always
i was much too far out all my life
and not waving but drowning
<|endoftext|>

when they are in use
when synagogues are
in ruins weeds are not to be picked there
<|endoftext|>

so much hurting to get to this moment
when i'm beneath you
wanting it to go on and to end
<|endoftext|>

forward the gracious hours have fared
and see
the sun is risen
<|endoftext|>

what do you see
i asked
but she didn't move or answer me
<|endoftext|>

our backs to the storm we play out
old anxieties losing each game to time and starting over
we must save what's being threatened and not ask why
<|endoftext|>

full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight
and custom lie upon thee with a weight
heavy as frost and deep almost as life
<|endoftext|>

just amazing
i think i could wrap my arms all the way around
the -miles-circumferenced earth
<|endoftext|>

the trumpet of a prophecy
o wind
if winter comes can spring be far behind
<|endoftext|>

there is a little lightning in his eyes
iron at the mouth
his brows ride neither too far up nor down
<|endoftext|>

in harvest time whilst she might go and glean
then well away
for she undone was clean
<|endoftext|>

peace quod the towny mouse why speakest thou so loud
and by the hand she took her fair and well
welcome quod she my sister by the rood
<|endoftext|>

and made her there against her will remain
that had forgotten her poor surety and rest
for seeming wealth wherein she thought to reign
<|endoftext|>

then seek no more out of thyself to find
the thing that thou hast sought so long before
for thou shalt feel it sitting in thy mind
<|endoftext|>

mad if ye list to continue your sore
let present pass and gape on time to come
and deep yourself in travail more and more

wherefrom fall all architectures i am
i say are likenesses of the first beloved
whose flowers are flames lit to the lady
<|endoftext|>

she it is queen under the hill
whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words
that is a field folded
<|endoftext|>

how some they have died and some they have left me
and some are taken from me all are departed
all all are gone the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

the loose earth shook
the very hills were stirred
the silence of the dead was all i heard
<|endoftext|>

what can be done we know
but have no fear
if you fail now we shall not see or hear
<|endoftext|>

the sun was over our town it was like a blade
kicking cottonwood leaves we ran toward storms
wherever we looked the land would hold us up
<|endoftext|>

dear christ
when thy new vintage fills my cup
this hand shall shake no more nor that wine spill
<|endoftext|>

not rain but fine mist
falls from my lemon tree
a balm of droplets in green shadow
<|endoftext|>

why aren't you here
where are you
come back
<|endoftext|>

lugging my exploded home
and trampling on my own name
i trek to a yearned deformation
<|endoftext|>

shut up smug face you know
nothing of ugliness even that
which you've long bankrolled
<|endoftext|>

the japanese earthquake shifted the axis of the earth
moving japan twelve feet closer to north america
each day shortened by one second
<|endoftext|>

the thinning shade of autumn is
an inherited oriental
red worn to pink nap worn to thread
<|endoftext|>

the basses of their beings throb
in witching chords and their thin blood
pulse pizzicati of hosanna
<|endoftext|>

must be time to get up i assumed
parked outside
border patrol vehicles i had to choose
<|endoftext|>

years old and look like a bad nail
by god they yanked me out
i can tell you
<|endoftext|>

ain't so much me i'm asking for
dog like to get out and piss
think they remember
<|endoftext|>

near the main gate of gary steel i stop
the amber light pours out of stacked horizons
monstrous cranes hang over suburbs
<|endoftext|>

the sangomo told marvin you are crushed by some
weight
only your own ancestors can help you
<|endoftext|>

your repentance all but obscured beneath
a burgeoning yellow fog of frankly more
conspicuous resentment is sufficient
<|endoftext|>

your intermittent concern for the sick
the suffering the needy poor is sometimes
recognizable to me if not to them
<|endoftext|>

aluminum
there was the smell of salt but it
was not the salt of the earth not the sea itself
<|endoftext|>

(then shall my fickle soul forget
thy agony of bloody sweat
my rifle hand is stiff and numb
<|endoftext|>

so let me render back again
this millionth of thy gift
amen
<|endoftext|>

o swallow flying from the golden woods
fly to her and pipe and woo her and make her mine
and tell her tell her that i follow thee
<|endoftext|>

in the dining room there is a brown fish
hanging on the wall who swims along
in his frame while we are eating dinner
<|endoftext|>

only the night air carries your words
up to the dead
i watched them rise become remote
<|endoftext|>

of all the questions you might want to ask
about angels the only one you ever hear
is how many can dance on the head of a pin
<|endoftext|>

if an angel fell off a cloud would he leave a hole
in a river and would the hole float along endlessly
filled with the silent letters of every angelic word
<|endoftext|>

you are humped higher and higher black as stone
you sit with your head like a carving in space
and the little green cat is a bug in the grass
<|endoftext|>

raggedy
raggedy
raggedy man
<|endoftext|>

it tells us in a ringing anthem like heavenly hosts uplifted
that the rhapsody of the pastoral is out to lunch
we can take it from there
<|endoftext|>

and who are these guys on the bus
who glide in golden hats past us
on their way to kansas city
<|endoftext|>

a goodly place a goodly time
for it was in the golden prime
of good haroun alraschid
<|endoftext|>

there beyond the dykes
i heard wind flaking sapphire like this summer
and willows could not hold more steady sound
<|endoftext|>

on the door it says what to do to survive
but we were not born to survive
only to live
<|endoftext|>

and this oh love my pitiable plight
whenever from my circling arms you stray
this little world of mine has lost its light
<|endoftext|>

at home in the barton you said thee' and thou
your talking quite fits 'ee for high compa-ny
some polish is gained with one's ruin said she
<|endoftext|>

don't judge him
the courtyard's orange trees where once
he washed like a morisco are teaching his tongue the craft
<|endoftext|>

the only protection
against death
was to love solitude
<|endoftext|>

the view
the plain's hatching now
after rainless months
<|endoftext|>

you  who i don't know  i don't know how to talk to you
what is it like for you there
here
<|endoftext|>

most people are to the right
when it comes to where they must
eat and lay their heads
<|endoftext|>

at the intersection of poverty and plague
the planet's children brave uncontrollable juiced
out of their gourds invent the sacred dance
<|endoftext|>

i picked them just for you
i promise
i will try to stay on my side of the couch
<|endoftext|>

outside my window just now
i can hear a small waterfall rippling antiphonally down over
the stones of my poem
<|endoftext|>

word after word
floats through the glass
towards me
<|endoftext|>

song have thy day and take thy fill of light
before the night be fallen across thy way
sing while he may man hath no long delight
<|endoftext|>

here one calendar takes eighteen years
i am three
one day is an eyelash
<|endoftext|>

all pains the immortal spirit must endure
all weakness which impairs all griefs which bow
find their sole speech in that victorious brow
<|endoftext|>

the stitchery the trill the body electric
the fingertip pressure exquisite as it sings
the braille of here and here and here
<|endoftext|>

one man in the sun alone
walks between the silence and the stone
the city rises from his flesh his bone
<|endoftext|>

but an honest joy
does itself destroy
for a harlot coy
<|endoftext|>

welcome flowers
write your name on a name tag
find a seat
<|endoftext|>

raise your leaf if you've taken a class here before
let's go around the room
call out your colors
<|endoftext|>

i see someone's petal has fallen
please pick it up and put it in your desk
where it belongs
<|endoftext|>

sprinklers at recess
fertilizer for lunch
and you may snack on the sun throughout the day
<|endoftext|>

excuse me
what's that in your mouth
a bee
<|endoftext|>

did you
bring enough
for everyone
<|endoftext|>

simplicity so graven hurts the sense
the monumental and the simple break
and the great tablets shatter down in deed
<|endoftext|>

every year the quick particular jig
of unresolved event moves in the mind
and there's the trick simplicity has to win
<|endoftext|>

dim is the rumour of a common fight
where host meets host and many names are sunk
but of a single combat fame speaks clear
<|endoftext|>

so spake he and ferood stood forth and cried
old man be it agreed as thou hast said
let sohrab arm and we will find a man
<|endoftext|>

but i will fight unknown and in plain arms
let not men say of rustum he was match'd
in single fight with any mortal man
<|endoftext|>

and rustum came upon the sand and cast
his eyes toward the tartar tents and saw
sohrab come forth and eyed him as he came
<|endoftext|>

art thou not rustum
speak
art thou not he
<|endoftext|>

but with a cold incredulous voice he said
what prate is this of fathers and revenge
the mighty rustum never had a son
<|endoftext|>

i tell thee prick'd upon this arm i bear
that seal which rustum to my mother gave
that she might prick it on the babe she bore
<|endoftext|>

how say'st thou
is that sign the proper sign
of rustum's son or of some other man's
<|endoftext|>

but now in blood and battles was my youth
and full of blood and battles is my age
and i shall never end this life of blood
<|endoftext|>

and rustum gazed in sohrab's face and said
soon be that day my son and deep that sea
till then if fate so wills let me endure
<|endoftext|>

blissful mary mother mild
maid and mother undefiled
save a mother and her child
<|endoftext|>

she shrugs not really
they know what to do
they're goats
<|endoftext|>

in the black of desire
we rock and grunt grunt and
shine
<|endoftext|>

failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged
missing me one place search another
i stop somewhere waiting for you
<|endoftext|>

my people of morrisville
who live
where all the ends are wrong
<|endoftext|>

useless to warn the girl whosehand will always be reaching out for the flowers or
the sisters inflamed with schiller as he with the tricolor
dream of a world he could never inhabit
<|endoftext|>

yet do thy worst old time
despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young
<|endoftext|>

oh my oh my i lose myself
i study atlases and cirrus paths
in search of traces of it of you
<|endoftext|>

he wished to have me in his sight
once as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
to come and touch my hand
<|endoftext|>

a simple thing
yet i wept for it
this
<|endoftext|>

loved yesterday
are only dear
because thy name moves right in what they say
<|endoftext|>

administered citizen achieving condition of robot
in public mind things not so good these days
nor in wrong run will it matter to tu fu
<|endoftext|>

the same curves
to her stance the same
breasts beneath summer cloth
<|endoftext|>

the clean hole
in the center heaven
the spaces we left empty
<|endoftext|>

at dawn he is still there invisible short of breath mending his net
all morning we look for the white face to rise from the lake like a tiny star
and when it does we lie back in our watery hair and rock
<|endoftext|>

it is not enough that yearly down this hill
april
comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers
<|endoftext|>

butane propane
and lungful of diesel
i did not stand a chance
<|endoftext|>

always with poison
breath bill responsibility
a man with rote hands
<|endoftext|>

what do you want with one of those blame things
i asked him well beforehand
don't you get one
<|endoftext|>

it's a star-splitter if there ever was one
and ought to do some good if splitting stars
'sa thing to be compared with splitting wood
<|endoftext|>

turned a ruby gown
here there is no language
for officer or law no color to call white
<|endoftext|>

if snow fell it'd fall black
please don't call
us dead call us alive someplace better
<|endoftext|>

and it is too easy to get lost in abstraction
as if smoke and dream and quantum ersatz-states
are our proper environment
<|endoftext|>

we can spend all day and many days and years in theorizing
a computer recreation of proto-hominid dietary intake
an analysis
<|endoftext|>

we'll float off through these foggy lands of argot
in the way that someone else might dissolve in the blue cloud
of an opium den
<|endoftext|>

when hegemonic identity-structures systemize cognition whoa
there are times i think my friends might flimmer away in that
high-minded mush
<|endoftext|>

child when you're sad put on your blue shoes
you know that mama loves you lollipops
and daddy still has a job to lose
<|endoftext|>

it is summer-gone that i see it is summer-gone
the sweet flowers indrying and dying down
the grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown
<|endoftext|>

the main building lit up
like a liner on saturday night
the sound of the band
<|endoftext|>

i could hear the porch swing squeak
and see into the parlor
it was divided by a curtain or screen
<|endoftext|>

i suppose we ought to go
i say
and she says not yet
<|endoftext|>

do you know what whole fields are
they are fields with a dog and a moon
do you know the answer  for the many
<|endoftext|>

except there would be vineyards
meaning there would as usual be commerce
money and a game of sorts to play it
<|endoftext|>

well there's not much to say
i wish i had a pet
or something i could play
<|endoftext|>

when it's you standing there with a letter
or voice or face full of solemn news
will you hold your breath before you knock
<|endoftext|>

as for me i continue eating
i liked you better the way you were
but you were always ambitious
<|endoftext|>

someone tell the lord to leave me alone
i've had enough of his love
that feels like burning and flight and running away
<|endoftext|>

we prized it dearly while it stood we said
our friend the gipsy-scholar was not dead
while the tree lived he in these fields lived on
<|endoftext|>

needs must i lose them needs with heavy heart
into the world and wave of men depart
but thyrsis of his own will went away
<|endoftext|>

fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay
woods with anemonies in flower till may
know him a wanderer still then why not me
<|endoftext|>

so have i not unmoved in mind
seen birds of tempest-loving kind
thus beating up against the wind
<|endoftext|>

no feeding in the wake of cavalry or kings changed it
even in the end it swerved away  amp made the abrupt
riddle all things come to seem
<|endoftext|>

other dogs may be thy peers
haply in these drooping ears
and this glossy fairness
<|endoftext|>

they know their audience
french fried lives french fried
luck french fried us
<|endoftext|>

this is your portion this your native store
heav'n that but once was prodigal before
to shakespeare gave as much she could not give him more
<|endoftext|>

we all may have our homes in joy and peace
when woman's life in its rich power of love
is joined with man's to care for all the world
<|endoftext|>

ii
thou chosen sister of the spirit
that gazes on thee till in thee it pities
<|endoftext|>

what next she had design'd heaven only knows
to such immod'rate growth her conquest rose
that fate alone its progress could oppose
<|endoftext|>

but thus orinda died
heav'n by the same disease did both translate
as equal were their souls so equal was their fate
<|endoftext|>

there thou sweet saint before the choir shall go
as harbinger of heav'n the way to show
the way which thou so well hast learn'd below
<|endoftext|>

are we this simple then
to sing all day  country songs
old hymns camp tunes
<|endoftext|>

all cities are open in the hot season
northward or southward the summer gives out
few telephone numbers but no one in our house sleeps
<|endoftext|>

there shall that voice crying for justice be heard
but the local colorist broken on cliffs of laughter
at the late dew point of pity collect only the irony of serene stars
<|endoftext|>

making his advances
he does not look at her nor sniff at her
no not even sniff at her his nose is blank
<|endoftext|>

i thought he was dumb
i said he was dumb
yet i've heard him cry
<|endoftext|>

patch
if whom they love my envy must pursue
'tis sure at least i never envy you
<|endoftext|>

overlit
not a scream the mute button pushed
generally the patient has the sense
<|endoftext|>

twang chic sweeter than honey or money or
running through the red clay gully the forlorn
moan of the midnight macon train
<|endoftext|>

or a barber (prodding a chin
back into position
would be likely to notice
<|endoftext|>

bushes and grass along the glass-still way
were all dabbled with rain
and the road reeled with shattered skies
<|endoftext|>

this made us smile and laugh at last
there was
rejoicing all night long in mytilene
<|endoftext|>

a child is vengeance
a child is a missile into the coming generations
i launched him: i'm still trembling
<|endoftext|>

had i but plenty of money money enough and to spare
the house for me no doubt were a house in the city-square
ah such a life such a life as one leads at the window there
<|endoftext|>

something to see by bacchus something to hear at least
there the whole day long one's life is a perfect feast
while up at a villa one lives i maintain it no more than a beast
<|endoftext|>

and the duke's guard brings up the rear for the better prevention of scandals
bang-whang-whang goes the drum tootle-te-tootle the fife
oh a day in the city-square there is no such pleasure in life
<|endoftext|>

whenas in silks my julia goes
then then how sweetly flows
that liquefaction of her clothes
<|endoftext|>

next when i cast mine eyes and see
that brave vibration each way free
o how that glittering taketh me
<|endoftext|>

for their indulgent love and tender care
all is forgot this love he doth despise
they brought this bird up to pick out their eyes
<|endoftext|>

lonely winters
when there was nothing
to say
<|endoftext|>

how do the children convert their troubles
into hip-hop
dunno but it's wonderful
<|endoftext|>

waking at night now as the snow
flakes from darkness to darkness go
past yellow lights in the street below
<|endoftext|>

since persia fell at marathon
the yellow years have gathered fast
long centuries have come and gone
<|endoftext|>

for five billion years
we have seen the past and
it works
<|endoftext|>

inside the veins there are navies setting forth
tiny explosions at the waterlines
and seagulls weaving in the wind of the salty blood
<|endoftext|>

now we wake and rise from bed and eat breakfast
shouts rise from the harbor of the blood
mist and masts rising the knock of wooden tackle in the sunlight
<|endoftext|>

now we sing and do tiny dances on the kitchen floor
our whole body is like a harbor at dawn
we know that our master has left us for the day
<|endoftext|>

here at the edge of the millennium
i don't imagine
you'd call them anything as archaic as angels
<|endoftext|>

small wonder the angels are said to despise us
still without them
how do we account for our meanness
<|endoftext|>

the bering strait: one humpback whale plump
and bardic an orca caught on the ascending arc
salt droplets flung from a flange of soot-black fin
<|endoftext|>

pale petals of the roses in the dark
warm bellies of the sleeping deer
that's what going to sleep is like
<|endoftext|>

circumcision does it to us
as in the bible story of shechem and the sons of jacob
so that we go on hurting all our lives
<|endoftext|>

spilled blood is not the roots of trees
but it's the closest thing to roots
we have
<|endoftext|>

jazz june
we
die soon
<|endoftext|>

the three languages i know
all the colors in which i see and dream
none will help me
<|endoftext|>

what else
nothing
blue lights of police cars
<|endoftext|>

what else
nothing
nothing
<|endoftext|>

on the leaves on the meadow grass
on the wickerwork of shrubs
dark cape of desire
<|endoftext|>

the poem slips away through slots of lace
liquefied as a fat caterpillar
dressed in the capsule of a cocoon
<|endoftext|>

rides her many-stickered bicycle
backward up the staircase
of the abandoned trolleybarn
<|endoftext|>

a couple of sparks a few more
a flash of light a slow increase in heat
and radiating around you: uncontainable fire
<|endoftext|>

there are so many roots to the tree of anger
that sometimes the branches shatter
before they bear
<|endoftext|>

and sit here wondering
which me will survive
all these liberations
<|endoftext|>

ah beauty
as i led her to the window
i told her: you i loved best in life
<|endoftext|>

until a white bird flew across the road
with its mysterious message that said to some
turn back and to the rest go on
<|endoftext|>

the first time
i went to the tree
was to knock on wood
<|endoftext|>

his death had sockets and keys it had walls and beams
it had a handle which you could not hold and a floor
you could not lie down on in the middle of the night
<|endoftext|>

for a while i'll let it make you strong
make your heart lion
then i'll take it back
<|endoftext|>

those you love come at you like lightning
crackle for an instant so kissable
and then lips and all they're gone
<|endoftext|>

must represent the governess
for of course the creature itself
could not inspire such terror
<|endoftext|>

when the window opened of its own accord
in the big walnut tree
were six or seven wolves
<|endoftext|>

believe her indian eyes her sly french smile
her breast with its veins skim milk blue
she is the myth that is true
<|endoftext|>

and here face downward in the sun
to feel how swift how secretly
the shadow of the night comes on
<|endoftext|>

between basalt cliffs
no one mourns
the loss of statecraft
<|endoftext|>

i did look sharp as a lynx
when models arrived some minx
tripped up-stairs she and her ankles
<|endoftext|>

boat me around gently
whoever i'm with
i'm seeing only you
<|endoftext|>

i have seen
the old gods go
and the new gods come
<|endoftext|>

but let's not yearn for the days of prenormalization
just think of the torments the anxieties the sweat
the wiles needed to entice in spite of all
<|endoftext|>

everything has thorns
at first sight think twice
before trusting even a good omen
<|endoftext|>

the friend i saw each day and never spoke to
because i hoped soon to disappear from there
as i have disappeared into the heaven of better days
<|endoftext|>

yea while i found all wisdom
they grieved for me
i should have grieved for them
<|endoftext|>

chicken squints
doesn't think
it's funny
<|endoftext|>

forced to wear a gaudy gold star
to surrender their pride
they do their best to look alive
<|endoftext|>

but whumpp
the bird attacked
the glass again
<|endoftext|>

his long claws
scuffled at the pane
and i yelled crow
<|endoftext|>

admit you'd like to find something
discarded or damaged even gone
and lift it back into the world
<|endoftext|>

she was a great master and died young
leaving me with unrelieved grief
her talents known to only a few
<|endoftext|>

my dear children do you remember the morning
when we climbed into the old plymouth
and drove west straight toward the pacific
<|endoftext|>

when something becomes ash
there's nothing you can do to turn it back
about this even diamonds do not lie
<|endoftext|>

iowa's unruly grass submits blade by blade
a yellow hill rises
and the shy man finds perfection in his art
<|endoftext|>

the living let our days be patterned after
theirs
is it not marvelous to be forgetful
<|endoftext|>

this marky lived a while my braves a while and then he died
honor the cork of comstock and the pies of mrs
yapp
<|endoftext|>

bringing us noway coolness but burning thirst
giving us noway peace but implacable strife
loosing upon us the wounding joy and the wasting sorrow of life
<|endoftext|>

ma i say you mean cut off
loose and cut off  being as far apart
as say son and daughter
<|endoftext|>

that's roll
i say throwing up my hands
as in hot dog hamburger dinner roll
<|endoftext|>

a light on
i may have to come ashore
some distance from where i set in
<|endoftext|>

he guesses the flower will slip
fragile
from one century to the next with its prayer
<|endoftext|>

but bluer than the lips of lazarus baby
before sweet jesus himself could figure out
what else in the world to do but weep
<|endoftext|>

in our hammocks our hats tipped
forwards hands folded neatly
like bamboo huts above our hearts
<|endoftext|>

so i will wait
like a fly on the tip of a stick
until he is finished
<|endoftext|>

why the human heart still slows
when divers break the surface
why mermaids still swim in our dreams
<|endoftext|>

from across the field with a word who
can speak for the willow and the zinnia
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree
<|endoftext|>

the paper table cloth was tastefully bleak
the misty morning light shone on his cheek
and made him look alone and masculine
<|endoftext|>

he talked of seneca and bad translations
of modern critics' lightweight observations
a bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin
<|endoftext|>

behind him through the glass the ocean's heave
uncurled against the sand beside his sleeve
as eros aimed his toxic javelin
<|endoftext|>

instead this conversation about art
and formal education god he's smart
such rationality should be a sin
<|endoftext|>

under this crushing burden when with a single word
you could be a god one of the few gods
who when called on really listens
<|endoftext|>

listen and you can hear them whisper
in the rushes gazing out at us wondering
what lives are these
<|endoftext|>

instead i walk out on a summer morning
to the sound of birds and a waterfall
is a beaded curtain brushing over my shoulders
<|endoftext|>

how easy he has made it for me to enter here
to sit down in a corner
cross my legs like his and listen
<|endoftext|>

might offer a vital lesson
to any apostate instinct
aspiring to survive
<|endoftext|>

saying graduate
of the school of flesh
father conspirator
<|endoftext|>

but who will hide from us
who will keep digging for us
here in the cloud of ashes
<|endoftext|>

slips grief into a careless pocket
breaks it to pieces
lets it go
<|endoftext|>

like snow falling in the darkness of the house
the silence before i wrote a word
and the poorer silence now
<|endoftext|>

no longer can he pose with comrade stalin
admiring the moscow-volga canal
now he is water
<|endoftext|>

and now the past itself is air is water and finally fire
whitening to ash
in his fat fingers its pages flare
<|endoftext|>

is not a god
the only god is the sun
our mind master of all crickets and clocks
<|endoftext|>

it is important
to stay sweet
and loving
<|endoftext|>

he picks at the wounds
on his crucified body the injury
scabbed over with jewels
<|endoftext|>

keeping all the grim social hate
safe
in him
<|endoftext|>

lately the weather aches
the air is short of breath
and morning stumbles in stiff-jointed
<|endoftext|>

even the seasons change
with a throb of weariness
bud bloom leaf fall
<|endoftext|>

i would but who am i
to try to cheer up
the self-indulgent universe
<|endoftext|>

tastes leafy and sweet
and has the power
the old ones say to heal
<|endoftext|>

perhaps to those familiar with their ways
the sight would not have been so startling
a deer fording the missouri in the early afternoon
<|endoftext|>

at one point she hit upon a shoal
and appeared to walk upon a mantle
the light glancing off her thin legs and black hooves
<|endoftext|>

and now i long to bear witness of such things
to tell someone in need the story
of a deer fording the missouri in the early afternoon
<|endoftext|>

inside the northern general
they're trying to burn away
a small piece of your heart
<|endoftext|>

i want to know which bit
how much
and what it holds
<|endoftext|>

the mind's black kettle hisses its wild
exigencies at every turn: the hour before the coffee
and the hour after
<|endoftext|>

penscratch of the gone morning woman
a pitched hysteria watching the mad-ant scramble
her small wants devouring
<|endoftext|>

her binge and skin-thrall
her old selves being shuffled off into labyrinths
this birdless sky a longing
<|endoftext|>

this hour a purge
of its own unselfing
she must make a home of it
<|endoftext|>

here in the cradle of thebes
a towering sphinx roams the garden
her wet dawn devouring
<|endoftext|>

it was the thought that
if you could watch if i could leak to the public the film of when i needed to reach you
that would be one way
<|endoftext|>

the day's owl and its omen
slipping a bright hook
into my cheek
<|endoftext|>

sees him at the far end of the strand
squamous in rubbery weed his knees bobbing
urchins his lean trunk leaning sea-treasure for her
<|endoftext|>

sea-scribbler's chest buckles
in aftershock
his quill is primed: squid-inked and witful
<|endoftext|>

devouring ammonia cyanide and sewage
as fast as we can produce them
this hydra emblem of insatiable desire
<|endoftext|>

meaning homeland  mulk
exactly how
my son demands milk
<|endoftext|>

yet after work while the boys and girls played
at tug of war wrestling or archery shy boy mugoo
and shy girl gugoo would draw the boys and girls
<|endoftext|>

i want a short obituary a life brief amp unfulfilled
the introductory melody before a beat's crescendo into song
the game over somewhere in the great plains
<|endoftext|>

arc or the promise of injury if i take a fall
my son
so distant from other children in his sadness
<|endoftext|>

how you wrote it down my friend held it
in the starless night
amp gave it pink fingers with which to scratch back
<|endoftext|>

when g died began the midnight panic attacks
he spoke french and english
but that didn't help
<|endoftext|>

a tendency to choke
and then how lavishly
it grew to overtake him
<|endoftext|>

flowery and young
came the mourners like bridesmaids
g would have liked it that way
<|endoftext|>

stilettos and stockings
the curves of the widow
sleek and sublimate in blacksilk pants
<|endoftext|>

elsewhere people
went shopping or to the movies
we drove to the crematorium
<|endoftext|>

i can only hope
so many beautiful women
come to my funeral m said
<|endoftext|>

(rude-blooming the flowers of paris
as if snout to blossom
could uncover could reinvoke
<|endoftext|>

i once loved a boy who built batteries
for pacemakers miniature machines
that could glint a heart to life
<|endoftext|>

a small bear stomping
across the table escape
on its mechanical mind
<|endoftext|>

what's within should be held in
choke it down
medicine for the long haul
<|endoftext|>

the magic settles uneasy it turns out fairy dust was always
fake
and the lipstick's made from beetles shells crushed vermillion
<|endoftext|>

and yet their voices sweeten the snaking air
providing the transvestites their proper muses
all of whom have streets named for them in the garden district
<|endoftext|>

but in this room on this costly bed our lovemaking
starts out the slowest grind then like this city's weather
goes from hot to hotter from moist to rainstorm wet
<|endoftext|>

we sniggered as the singing voice came closer
so close we began to sing along conspirators smiling
and we welcomed the doleful silence at the song's inevitable end
<|endoftext|>

my memory of a perfect scent: pine sage and cypress
my friends' faith in the power of rough and winding paths
to take me up a mountain and bring me back
<|endoftext|>

paperbacks record albums text books piled up azaleas on the
parkway
a howl of buzzing bees late spring just before graduation
<|endoftext|>

their bungalow has dueling computers and a real backyard
while nancy and mike's boxes are slowly being unpacked
their bicycles are carefully racked inside their front door
<|endoftext|>

oh my friends who love to hike to ski to bike and me they love
are driving me from boise to ketchum through mountain and
valley beauty
<|endoftext|>

high desert heat is clear dry and when your body rises out of a
chilly car
blam
<|endoftext|>

i used to watch death valley days
death was hinted but not shown the wagon turned over
the wagon train a going
<|endoftext|>

o those long-suffering white people fearful of indians and scared of
bandits
desperate for shade for water for land flowing milk and honey
<|endoftext|>

stewards of american beauty these are the paths my friends make
in wild places
the rise and fall of future walks
<|endoftext|>

the laugh that he laughed
that he wished wasn't his went
hruck sniffle-hick hee-haw
<|endoftext|>

mama has happened
and the rocking horse of your heart
heaves on
<|endoftext|>

my mouth is snow slowly caking that stiff pigeon
my mouth the intricately moist machinery of a plant
i have forgotten if i ever had a mouth
<|endoftext|>

i have two mouths
one like warm rain
or wind manipulating the worn limbs of an elm
<|endoftext|>

i shall survive this death even though the heart is
a shadow of a bone
or thick glass
<|endoftext|>

now wisdom is sour rubbing medicine pasted
over nightmares not the proper wealth of an old man
the arms of his neighbors around him like laurels
<|endoftext|>

aliens have inhabited my aesthetics for
decades
really since the early s
<|endoftext|>

as if you could leave
and
you thought gravity was a problem
<|endoftext|>

at least to those few
who knew a book
to be a friend
<|endoftext|>

we decided to go to the army
for we did not want to be roasted at home
like little pigs
<|endoftext|>

just
do not go
and multiply
<|endoftext|>

if i bow any lower
i will be looking up
at moss
<|endoftext|>

everyone i know wants to douse
the hungry flames flee the endless aftershocks
unravel every vexing question
<|endoftext|>

although i feel like a bird with a broken wing
each day i think of you i fumble an attempt to fly to impress you with
the color of my paper wings
<|endoftext|>

crows are the printed warnings
of a wasted life
they will never leave or abandon us
<|endoftext|>

and they sang to us
with human wings
upon which we sleep
<|endoftext|>

his official language became latin when he ceased to be a jew
biting his nails and collecting cans like a cheap minister with sunny gold teeth
the tender years that once wore oysters would never speak to him again

she is as hundreds of years old as
the stories of the lies
of grandmothers in the cellar
<|endoftext|>

may i ask who
your grandmother died if she died
herself
<|endoftext|>

stopping by woods on a snowy evening he murmurs
something about the dark side of life how awful it can be
as i begin to track silence and signal to a cold source
<|endoftext|>

the picture was magic
and so was johnnie and jill
though not a children's classic
<|endoftext|>

i walked on the hill this summer
tamely carefully slowly
alongside my mother
<|endoftext|>

routines of decaying time
fade and your waking life
gets laborious as science
<|endoftext|>

and a restart of tense
summons your waking size
out through shreds of story
<|endoftext|>

i saw sheep herding and shearing
admired the baby lambs and followed
the from sheep to sweater interpretive trail
<|endoftext|>

i sit on my dock
dangling my feet in the water
counting dragonflies
<|endoftext|>

the boys laughed
said shhh
and stood me up
<|endoftext|>

it's too soon for the front porch swing
no crocuses are opeing
the wind is from the north and chill
<|endoftext|>

the mockingbird has testified
to spring's existence and i see
the buds are on the almond tree
<|endoftext|>

the poem dreams of bodies always leadless bearing
only things ordinary
as water amp light
<|endoftext|>

one day i'll leave not you
but all this this hunger
that pushes each wave
<|endoftext|>

cement is pumped so it bumps top wiper plug
at twelve thirty
then two pressure tests
<|endoftext|>

onds later
it was not yet ten
o'clock when the mayday call was first made
<|endoftext|>

i recognize in its warm death the expression of the starving
with the o-gape of complete despair
i live here
<|endoftext|>

at the end they soberly bong out their names
myths and ideals i could never bring myself to believe in
my prayers the self-flagellation of unrequited love
<|endoftext|>

buses pointing out the hood amp back
the route
every morning goes by the liquor store
<|endoftext|>

he worries about the hazing the beatings
you tell him this is an opportunity
don't miss it
<|endoftext|>

the blankets are big with his body
the cat under the covers
because it is cold out and she is not stupid mews
<|endoftext|>

such gentility
reins all vigor
all caution
<|endoftext|>

thought he knew
presents a gap
between her upper foreteeth when she smiles
<|endoftext|>

the hovering body of a fiery sparrow is almost
transparent
like flute music or an idea
<|endoftext|>

i turn my back
and finally i spot her
my friend the host
<|endoftext|>

she's sipping rum punch from a martini glass
her whole body appears to be smiling glowing
and i don't know what to think
<|endoftext|>

could the cusan speak of love as a return
a plentitude of absence an imprecise
count of the dark from which he would always turn
<|endoftext|>

the binukedine know how to entice
the expansive energy flowing from grace
an absolute measure a stellar device
<|endoftext|>

i would propose a failed sun a sacrifice
that spins an ambiguous body in time
in trust to a sacred field death's other price
<|endoftext|>

what established light will move
or change the structure of light
light an order to disprove
<|endoftext|>

bogged in a bone order syntax and substance
of the passing world i place
my duge in the fragile arms of silence
<|endoftext|>

so much for the quick embrace
of the ceasing instant the chaste argument
only the dead can efface
<|endoftext|>

say that i have written my absolute descent
and stable transformation
through a sounding tone to one that now is spent
<|endoftext|>

the ascent out of despair
must be steady slow or your lungs
will explode your blood boil
<|endoftext|>

he squeezed
around my throat so tight
i thought i'd die with him
<|endoftext|>

there's a lot going on in
the
zombie apocalypse
<|endoftext|>

but wouldn't she recognize
that her mother
was a zombie
<|endoftext|>

so you can decide on your own and he wants
for you not to doubt this: even more blessed
you will be you have heard  and not seen
<|endoftext|>

i would stand for hours in one spot
and scores of little kids who hadn't had
a wash for weeks would group round me

i've never been crazy about donuts
but these are the aristocrats
of the donut world and i salute them

i was the sometimes boy on a leash
my sliver of assent in
as if it were my decision
<|endoftext|>

the pool shark lurked but not to fear
the end unknowable blue inmost and cold
like the comfort of a diplomatic war
<|endoftext|>

wired within
perhaps ignoble i'm still glad
when one spits on his own: they're bad
<|endoftext|>

he put the word
back into her
a heavy kind of music
<|endoftext|>

go out early in the morning no shoes no hats no ties
and quick as a toad's tongue can reach
love wounded the hearts of the mad and the wise
<|endoftext|>

around a drain an old appointment they keep
with an inescapable place this argument
no way claude says to be any less afraid
<|endoftext|>

it's almost may
and yesterday
i saw a firefly
<|endoftext|>

you don't see
them a lot
in the city
<|endoftext|>

it's almost may
and yesterday
i caught a firefly in my hand
<|endoftext|>

first firefly i
seen in a
long long time

make a wish
miss edna said
make a good one
<|endoftext|>

how far
the world you knew  amp tall
amp filled finally with strangers
<|endoftext|>

then his voice gets real low and he says
and when it's january and all cold like this
feels like june's a long long ways away
<|endoftext|>

i guess them arguing
on a tuesday in january's an occasion
so i guess this is an occasional poem
<|endoftext|>

i still got his hat
it's light blue
with con edison in white letters
<|endoftext|>

the kitchen sink just overflowed
a flash flood washed away the school
i threw your blanket in the trash
<|endoftext|>

from columbus my father said
you could go just about
anywhere

it whirs as my mother whips it
through the air and down
against my brother's legs
<|endoftext|>

a poem in three parts
a riot is the language of the unheard
martin luther king jr
<|endoftext|>

for ev'n when death dissolves our humane frame
the soul returns to heav'n from whence it came
earth keeps the body verse preserves the fame
<|endoftext|>

and this moment as it happens
our echoing hush as we try to hold
the close music of the blackbird in the bush
<|endoftext|>

were needed to recapture that first exposure says
the voice-over: as though ansel adams were a pioneer
toiling after the spirit not just the body of america
<|endoftext|>

is ansel adams and ansel adams the filter
light renders each tree a bouquet of paper
the great depression gathers like so much weather
<|endoftext|>

oh ye patrons of greyfriar's inn i would exclaim
i am here to meet your high-waisted jane
to embrace her as my comrade as my brother-in-arms
<|endoftext|>

the instruments set down the stage lights dimmed
thank you very much
goodnight graceland
<|endoftext|>

disease took hold with sudden force
we thought that we could hush the moans
so skinned and burned the flagging horse and let the fire consume its bones
<|endoftext|>

my children's skin turned cold and flushed
acquainted as i was with death
i saw their end and held their trust so cut their throats and sucked their breath
<|endoftext|>

and bundled out helplessly from sunlight the usual day
and all particulars of life there fled except the sense that stays
with me for hours and hours that i was valuable and needed there
<|endoftext|>

we'd bindle paradise and stow it where the dust bunnies futz
given leave
swindle us please some less dear salvation
<|endoftext|>

canvas banners thrashing in the storm
chinese lanterns chase across the speckled dusk
like molten bloodhounds packed against the moon
<|endoftext|>

my dad said
could be doing with a suck
on a spliff
<|endoftext|>

down into the pines
down into the flames
down into the rave
<|endoftext|>

when i walk away
i'll leave behind a trail
of lamp-bright rind
<|endoftext|>

we drink too much pineapple rum straight from the bottle
bitch about the red-haired girl the fetish model
a preacher's daughter with a thing for unreasonable shoes
<|endoftext|>

from her faded patchwork quilt bleeding
hearts we watched her mutate into a pvc alice liddell
how did she manage in seven-inch patent heels
<|endoftext|>

my mother's hair
which spans the length
is long washed and uncut
<|endoftext|>

in the field
shepherd's purse
to be seen even in the dark
<|endoftext|>

more than that i remember the flat-seed pouch
weed some call it as if to flourish and seed
in the poorest soil is to be just that
<|endoftext|>

look
a man walks into a field
a field with shepherd's purse
<|endoftext|>

i was the good thief
i held my love's
sweet breath his beautiful intelligent gaze
<|endoftext|>

every girl will ask you to dance and the boys
won't kill you for it
shake your head
<|endoftext|>

in the temper and the tantrum in the well-kept arboretum
i am waiting like an animal
for poetry
<|endoftext|>

isn't that what they say
that and that
historical events exchange glances with nothingness
<|endoftext|>

i am not writing a book about shopping which is a woman shopping
i am not writing accounts of dreams  not my own or anyone else's
i am not writing historical re-enactments of any durational literature
<|endoftext|>

i am not writing a history of these times or of past times or of any future
times and not even the history of these visions which are with me all day
and all of the night
<|endoftext|>

saying goodbye to a ghost is a hoax
the birds are still in flight
unhook the birds
<|endoftext|>

the erratic footprints of birds upon the sand or lacerations
no limbs at our disposal only the desire of limbs to reflesh
the ghost gestures

prajnaparamita
can you hear me
<|endoftext|>

remember the pears they were so green
and the avocados like guitars honey-golden and
the asparagus like a lion's rainy mane and
<|endoftext|>

a little closer
to the chalk dust this child swinging her left arm
a ribbon agitated by unnamed forces devoured

foamy waves wash to shore treasures as a sacrifice to damp

real life
i could have screamed the day john proposed winterizing
the cottage and living there permanently
<|endoftext|>

something to think about
perhaps in our mad scramble to keep our heads above water
we miss the point
<|endoftext|>

human nature
why must we be so intent on destroying everything we
touch
<|endoftext|>

death is a funny thing
most people are afraid of it and yet
they don't even know what it is
<|endoftext|>

death is many different things to many different people
i
think it is safe to say however that most people don't like it
<|endoftext|>

i think it's always nice to know that you are not alone
even
in death
<|endoftext|>

another comforting thought about death is that years or
so after you die nobody who knew you will still be alive to miss
you
<|endoftext|>

did you know that the first poems john ashbery ever had
published were published in poetry magazine under the name of
joel symington

when i lived in boston i used to panhandle on the street
where all of the art galleries were and i got my cigarette butts
from the urns in front of the museum of fine arts

a series of emoticons

what we said we found that night
by these and no other
means

it deepens
it begins
the cyclical method

believing her i swallowed suds
thinking they'd work
from the inside out

i see the alley house at night dark i'm trying
to be pure again but i want all the tones
when you're dead you can have them

his handkerchief a pin or coin he'd touched
a button from his shirt a feather caught
on his coattail  such tokens would fetch a price
<|endoftext|>

blood of a witch
can you believe such a thing
i think you may be worldly after all
<|endoftext|>

better to leave at once
i met with him at dawn
we headed east
<|endoftext|>

to have but heard
a crowd of russet-coats imploring us
to such alms-deeds such tender ministries
<|endoftext|>

suppose you sit once more
why yes there if you like where you can see
my herb garden
<|endoftext|>

i planted it the year
dear alice passed: in summer you will wake and drowse
to delicate perfumes
<|endoftext|>

and yet
when it came (after much wrestling
not to begrudge our toil) the fall was swift
<|endoftext|>

i am tired of people
combing their hair
and dripping in gold
<|endoftext|>

on the sands of time
how to embrace introspection's anchor
like a long-lost brother
<|endoftext|>

it was my whole soul transported and all its certainties
that i existed beneath all the legends otherwise
as joy
<|endoftext|>

i give a piece quite near away
then another one and two to three
and say good-bye with some dismay
<|endoftext|>

i hold the script of the gone by matinee
before i ever found a scar a yawn a he
past the years i've spun to macrame
<|endoftext|>

soon i must go and she will stay
dwelling under the apple tree
never to wander blind in first foray
<|endoftext|>

don't have that one
word
this fire all there is
<|endoftext|>

i find it
you have to find it
it isn't love it's what
<|endoftext|>

when i spoke the words i am gay
i had let them fester like blood on a prison cell wall
i hadn't known that they would free themselves
<|endoftext|>

i kissed the darkness three times because it stole
those three merciless words from me
before my mother could
<|endoftext|>

of sudden motion in the mostly still
new dawn and drawn i rose to see the flight
our dark companions exiting the night
<|endoftext|>

i will stay until the bones are picked clean
i will stay until the wide wings swallow the last of the light
until the white bird is free at last

i'm sure laius looked at the crib

not a mermaid but a lovely human being
the whole thing reminds me of the man trying to rescue a birdcage from the burning house
i am not normally a hunter of relics but
<|endoftext|>

at family gatherings
a family friend liked gathering
the girls to make us sing rounds
<|endoftext|>

we always wanted the spooky one
have you seen the ghost of tom
long white bones with the rest all gone
<|endoftext|>

become the most common strangers
eventually
a street appears where they can meet again
<|endoftext|>

i'd rather not share it but look look
at us now
lemon drops and cherry bombs
<|endoftext|>

no longer interested in evil
the soul turns on its back
at the watering hole kicks its muscled legs
<|endoftext|>

and the dream of myself as a baby
emerging from the mortal
body hoof by gleaming hoof
<|endoftext|>

i went into one room and then i went into another
i was in a room inside a room
there i felt safe
<|endoftext|>

we gave birth to a new generation
never touched hidden inside the
puerto rican mountains
<|endoftext|>

we gave birth to a new generation
imaginable you-name-it-we-got-it
society
<|endoftext|>

strutting beautifully alert alive
many turning eyes wondering
admiring
<|endoftext|>

fast tongue moving street corner que
corta talk being invented at the insistence
of a smile
<|endoftext|>

think of them again except
as monsters like yourself
pitiable because unforgiving
<|endoftext|>

i make a reciprocal balance between light falling on the back of my eye to optic
nerve to pineal gland radiance stepping down to matter and my future self
opening out from this sight
<|endoftext|>

a moment extends to time passing as sense impression of a rose including new
joys where imagined roses roses i haven't yet seen or seen in books record as my
experience

my dress is a visual image of unconscious affirmative processes the way spontaneity
expresses its order as i create a world stocking it with small dogs on the runway

nothing near this terrific face
i never in real head'd defenestrate

they're
as good as rocks

the dead seal isn't a person it's poetry the seal
the hallmark

get  rid  of  the  controls
i want to

that queen that assyrian woman
was so cruel and that never
occurred to her

is this san francisco

got to get it together
from formal folk

<|endoftext|>

people will ask why should we care about this unattractive character
despite the fact that turning yourself into an admirable character
has been considered gauche for as long as i can recall
<|endoftext|>

the word transparent is often affixed to such efforts
while the mystification surrounding the unflattering self-portrait
at least provides some cover
<|endoftext|>

now someone will say you don't need cover
unless you're standing naked at a window
shouting 'look up here

have a good flight

in reproduction

<|endoftext|>

card game done why not get down to cases
up close her blue-green eyes seem less blase
all around you fools are pulling faces
<|endoftext|>

how brief it is that fiery burst of thunder
brief as life brief as a winter day
to croak because you made a stupid blunder
<|endoftext|>

and now this floating view down from the ceiling
blood soaks the spot where your dead body lay
what song what words express all that you're feeling
<|endoftext|>

and if the dead can escape their tombs then
you trap wind as it enters the statue's mouth
and command it to rise walk
<|endoftext|>

swimming in a drowned girl's lungs
they ask if it's true
if slaves are chained together on ships to prevent suicide
<|endoftext|>

all this down
you leave me
only a chimney
<|endoftext|>

we can't remember her name but we remember where
we buried her
in a blanket the color of a sky that refuses birds
<|endoftext|>

it makes us rich
as croesus in his golden tears
and we are rarely hated for it
<|endoftext|>

someone else's nostalgia honorable emotion
propelling ulysses toward ithaca and a woman
to set lilacs in her dooryard as her mother did
<|endoftext|>

without formal acknowledgment
she was most certainly
the head of a community american
<|endoftext|>

there are differences however if you care
to discover coming close respectfully
you must discover the landscape as you go
<|endoftext|>

ripples of fish moon luminous insects
frogs owls crickets at their sound
deer raccoon badger come down to drink
<|endoftext|>

at the water's edge the children are fishing
casting shadows from the enormous shoreline
everything functions in the function of summer
<|endoftext|>

and gradually and not by chance the action
stops the children hush back among rocks
and also watch with nothing to capture but dusk
<|endoftext|>

and i am not at all certain what all this means
if it means anything but feel with all my being
that i must write this down if i write anything
<|endoftext|>

he's been gone over twenty-five years
we are in beth israel cemetery
block  woodbridge new jersey for the unveiling and the sky is like lead
<|endoftext|>

a decade
go from a to z to list the dead  too many
to name but try: antoine byrd carlos delante
<|endoftext|>

we take up wet rags and wash each wooden key
down its surface wet music
pooling onto our skin
<|endoftext|>

to cuban ruben cross the hall who loved tongue amp chuck d father
figure by george michael  who od'd
at the tunnel in mama's leopard print dress
<|endoftext|>

reagan told us
from the small grave
of a tv screen
<|endoftext|>

you think as you watch it turn there beautiful
world that can know itself only by
world soon it must colonize and infect the stars
<|endoftext|>

what is tomorrow
that it cannot come
today
<|endoftext|>

i think every day of how i'd save myself save
josey: stab the bad guy fall feet first punch the great white
in his eyeball play dead in the bullet-ridden mass grave
<|endoftext|>

and i looked at the mini bar
and the bad abstract hotel art on the wall
and the dark tv set watching like a deacon
<|endoftext|>

i am sorry if you offended me
role of disabled artist
always be sorry
<|endoftext|>

no i'll wait until after i eat for another
but you go right ahead
here's a light
<|endoftext|>

what did you expect
ruins
demeter without arms in the british museum
<|endoftext|>

i don't believe in an afterlife she says
but after k
died i thought i might go after her
<|endoftext|>

in case i'm wrong
in case she's somewhere
waiting
<|endoftext|>

when we stacked our futile selves
against locked doors
our mumbles and groans
<|endoftext|>

through the dying trees
like an app
-aloosa spooked by gunfire
<|endoftext|>

besides you like leaks you're inside
the view as if hibernating
or crazy you try not to erupt
<|endoftext|>

hypothesize the rest
the languor and freshet
the crags the serrated parade
<|endoftext|>

ah ketty-san why so mori
maybe you need upgrade
of person
<|endoftext|>

why raspberry jam tree
acacia acuminata
mungart
<|endoftext|>

many of them because it was cold  went right on top
of their recent ancestors
it was an ice night
<|endoftext|>

she does not care who sees her as she grips the stone
grapes feels the smooth crumbling cold
enter her hand fingers embracing a thing more fundamental than earth bone grit
<|endoftext|>

for i have sized up a mountain's meters
come down jiffy by shake to the tune
of leagues and stones
<|endoftext|>

for once there was the measure
of what an ox could plow
in a single morning
<|endoftext|>

for one megalithic year i fixed my gaze
on the smiling meniscus against the gray wall
of graduated cylinder
<|endoftext|>

a truck two men one of them my son and
everything i ever owned and they
didn't even want to stop for lunch
<|endoftext|>

as icebergs cracked into halves
as jellyfish like thoughts were
passed secretly between people
<|endoftext|>

louis do you follow or do you fall
they said
are you short or is you tall
<|endoftext|>

on an island an open road
where an animal has been crushed
by something larger than itself
<|endoftext|>

it is mangled by four o'clock light soul
sour-sweet intestines flattened and raked
by the sun eyes still watchful savage
<|endoftext|>

he said tina your body came out floating
i was born in the middle of monsoon season
palm trees tearing the tin roofs
<|endoftext|>

all sins are an attempt to fill voids or rebuilding my grandfather's
house with hopkins in my head
as i ripped the tar and shingles off the old roof with a shovel
<|endoftext|>

grandfather worked for years him and the welder juan wagered
each year on who would return first to the yucatan
neither did
<|endoftext|>

he will cry without tears a broken carburetor of sobs
when i speak
spanish he shakes his head and reminds me he is the only mexican
<|endoftext|>

my skirt rushing north
there is something round and toothless
about my dolls
<|endoftext|>

laughing against a wall
my hair sweeps the windowsill
thighs show themselves
<|endoftext|>

ashes in mother's hair
ashes on my baby brother
the streets are arid driven toward fire
<|endoftext|>

if i hurry i will dance with my father before the sun sets
my slippers clicking
on a thin layer of rain
<|endoftext|>

how i wish i could go to that woman
with her legs up and rub her feet
put liniment on her legs
<|endoftext|>

for now our highest ambition
was simply to bear the light of the day
we had once been planning to seize
<|endoftext|>

might it have to do with the gross
imports of crude oil bush will come clean on
only when the tigris comes clean
<|endoftext|>

he would eftsoons get down to work
reaching into its wide-open wizen
while a helper clamped back its jaws
<|endoftext|>

dead brain living will little pills
entangling pain with adoration of it
morphine machine whose little beep
<|endoftext|>

simple aaaa from that a
first letter loved to hear it ache and fill
even at half breath
<|endoftext|>

look it's standard
no one but
a divine being or two makes perfect copy
<|endoftext|>

shed the machine
must be entirely flesh to fight
must be strategy instead of filling
<|endoftext|>

so many shouldering forward enjambed
now cross the styx with the ease of smoke
passing through a window screen
<|endoftext|>

depart
the shapes of things continuing for shapes
supercooled to the stillness of mortmain
<|endoftext|>

the spell is a mouth's
perilous-o as they dark circle the boats in
their most resplendent pliable armor
<|endoftext|>

is sometimes murderous lovelies their plotting
and resolve and why not
get these guys good the lechers
<|endoftext|>

miss what human is like or know any end
to waters half born to from where
they look up
<|endoftext|>

to o my god little fool's breath
triumphant all the way under and am i
not deserving
<|endoftext|>

above his pashto prayers
but we know enough to
leave the live feed low audio is for the analysts
<|endoftext|>

we look askew
head broken floor array light
array great distances life goals
<|endoftext|>

staked upon every border
guardians
protections have many faces
<|endoftext|>

misuse of the face as a streaming
desire
solution posted: get rid of all the niggers
<|endoftext|>

glory to those who their glances lowered
marched in the sixties to abortion tables
sparing the homeland its present stigma
<|endoftext|>

here's your mom here's your dad
welcome to being their flesh and blood
why do you look so sad
<|endoftext|>

here's your food here's your drink
also some thoughts if you care to think
welcome to everything
<|endoftext|>

here's your practically clean slate
welcome to it though it's kind of late
welcome at any rate
<|endoftext|>

here's your swarm and your huge beehive
welcome to the place with its roughly five
billion like you alive
<|endoftext|>

welcome to the phone book that stars your name
digits are democracy's secret aim
welcome to your claim to fame
<|endoftext|>

here's your mirror your dental gleam
here's an octopus in your dream
why do you try to scream
<|endoftext|>

here's your porch see the cars pass by
here's your shitting dog's guilty eye
welcome to its alibi
<|endoftext|>

here are your cicadas then a chickadee
the bulb's dry tear in your lemon tea
welcome to infinity
<|endoftext|>

here's your cemetery a well-kept glen
welcome to a voice that says amen
the end of the rope old man
<|endoftext|>

join your word to theirs
tell him
that it is we who are important
<|endoftext|>

perhaps such pleasures are denied
to those who never feel obliged
if there are such
<|endoftext|>

to fear no repercussions
nor dodge
the unkind person you bug
<|endoftext|>

round and round they go
with a ribbon and garlanded
flowers in hand
<|endoftext|>

but soon a scream made him arise
he started and saw two eyes of flame
on his pillow from whence the screaming came
<|endoftext|>

the ak wants to tell a different truth
a truth ungarbled that is so obvious
no one could possibly mistake its meaning
<|endoftext|>

if you look down the cyclops-eye of the barrel
what you'll see is a boy with trousers
rolled above his ankles
<|endoftext|>

you'll see a mouth of bone moving in syllables
that have the rapid-fire clarity
of a weapon that can fire rounds a minute
<|endoftext|>

the english has the slightly
too-formal sound of someone
being poured through the sieve of another language
<|endoftext|>

over there's a water tower under that's the bore hole
and here the body asks and asks about the role
it's asked to play: no matter how it's dressed
<|endoftext|>

like a nomad like a journalist like the hyena
who eats even the bones
and shits bone-white scat from the calcium
<|endoftext|>

and then the boy who rolls his pantlegs
up above his ankles because to let them drag along the ground
is to be unclean turns right before your eyes into a skeleton
<|endoftext|>

/ the coming
at km a wall of leaves spits green into the air
and hangs there beautiful and repulsive
<|endoftext|>

the tv ken doll anchor keeps complaining to their corpses
hey can't you get my flak jacket adjusted
so it doesn't crush my collar
<|endoftext|>

the young boy with trousers rolled waits at km
before them both is a door into the earth that swings back
like a cellar door in the last century
<|endoftext|>

here you can let yourself go in so many ways
the bomb pack strapped to your waist and detonated
by pushing send on your cell phone
<|endoftext|>

learning untying
the knot of yes but re
writing this  yes  yes
<|endoftext|>

their secret language
manischewitz she calls me for the sweetness
manitoba for the expanse
<|endoftext|>

deer rest in snow
charcoal muzzle to charcoal hoof heads slung over
their shoulders like swans
<|endoftext|>

will soon cool sunset winking out in my eyes and her eyes
welling in a language that once fell and rose
in drifts then melted starry she said starry into my warm coat

he'll sit through anything
as in days of yore he is

itinerant intonation  air
your woes all over again

it was early
it was a mission
it wasn't the first
<|endoftext|>

the wedding is over
summer is over
life please explain
<|endoftext|>

this book is nearly halfway read
i don't have a pill for that
the doctor said
<|endoftext|>

something little pedro always wanted to do
it's a cold day
man is garbage
<|endoftext|>

you are trying to solve a problem
you're almost certainly halfway done
maybe more
<|endoftext|>

you take some salt some alum
and put it into the problem
its color goes from yellow to royal blue
<|endoftext|>

rabbi says: if one saves one butterfly even with long wings
one butterfly that has fallen into water it may be said
he has saved the whole world

i shout to the woman
with my inside voice
oh well
<|endoftext|>

had been bungled sorely
we withheld our opinions sat in wait
we were good for a throwing
<|endoftext|>

and as always
sweetly hopeful as
only women can be
<|endoftext|>

the signature public
the only avant-garde
behind invention
<|endoftext|>

we climbed the pasture on the south crossed over
and came down on the north

the stranger who helps you up
wants to know you who are so used to
anything scribbled on a prescription blank
<|endoftext|>

just want the pain to go away you say
surprised to find yourself
reaching for someone else's hand
<|endoftext|>

and god grabbed
the little we'd been given the little we still had
and hustled on to the next dark street
<|endoftext|>

don't ask something
with a lifespan
how to change your life
<|endoftext|>

but mostly because they rarely spoke
of or noticed or even whispered
about and did not of course
<|endoftext|>

as if she was his
to run
no word he said could be tamed
<|endoftext|>

each flower and tree and bird as if to prove
a man's pursuit of knowledge is greater
than his shortcomings the limits of his vision
<|endoftext|>

i've made a joke of it this history
that links us  white father black daughter
even as it renders us other to each other
<|endoftext|>

they lie like stones and dare not shift
even asleep everyone hears in prison
dwayne betts deserves more than this dry ink for his teenage years in prison
<|endoftext|>

his whole family made a barricade of their bodies at the door to room
he died without the man he wanted
what use is love at home or in prison
<|endoftext|>

in that high noon
that holds all
the freshness of the morning
<|endoftext|>

my father who wanted your business
would squat down at your side
and sketch you a container for it
<|endoftext|>

we speak of rebellion when the kid
is a hellion and the folks are as mild
as a spoon
<|endoftext|>

i believe you can build a boat
i believe you can get to water
i do not believe you can get the boat on water
<|endoftext|>

a quick check of the ocean or any fire
is a reminder of how things seem
i can't seem to see them
<|endoftext|>

will we without the boat on water
always feel that we are missing
something basic to the picture
<|endoftext|>

you got it
roast beef on rye
you want lettuce on that
<|endoftext|>

you got it
no salt
you want tomato
<|endoftext|>

yes
tomato
no lettuce
<|endoftext|>

no no pickle
just tomato and mayo
and pepper
<|endoftext|>

right
a little pepper
no pickle
<|endoftext|>

or offend
luck's been no lady
truth a sneaky friend
<|endoftext|>

crows crows crows crows
then the slow flapaway over the hill
and the dead oak is naked
<|endoftext|>

dog at my pillow
dog at my feet
my own toothbrush

for the second time this week
i've watched snow fall at sunrise
dawn arrive on a breeze
<|endoftext|>

did you know that maryland
has no natural but only man-made lakes
nope
<|endoftext|>

whereas you with due forethought
and deliberation bite into
an apple's heart and wish it were your own
<|endoftext|>

where can we go
when our wings weigh more
than the rest of us
<|endoftext|>

hence an axe above each separate entrance
as the hero becomes hardly a voice
and the sad dogs appear on the screen
<|endoftext|>

the doors of the subway car imitate an o opening and closing
in the blood the o spirals its helix of defects genetic shadows
but there are no instructions for identifying loved ones who go crazy
<|endoftext|>

i am afraid i will walk the streets naked i am afraid i will shout
every fucked up thing that troubles or enchants me i will try to murder
or make love to everybody before the police handcuff or murder me
<|endoftext|>

you must look without looking to make the perfect circle
the line the mind must be a blind continuous liquid
until the drawing is complete
<|endoftext|>

i wanted to make myself like the ravine
so that all good things
would flow into me
<|endoftext|>

compare those with the risks
of becoming a well
with a well-bolted lid
<|endoftext|>

the palm stands on the edge of space
the wind moves slowly in the branches
the bird's fire-fangled feathers dangle down
<|endoftext|>

that's what misery is
nothing to have at heart
it is to have or nothing
<|endoftext|>

it is a thing to have
a lion an ox in his breast
to feel it breathing there
<|endoftext|>

he is like a man
in the body of a violent beast
its muscles are his own
<|endoftext|>

the lion sleeps in the sun
its nose is on its paws
it can kill a man
<|endoftext|>

he was trying to teach me to economize with my language
strindberg gray
he said instead of

and your genial smile made it plain: you were pleased
by my wish to please
and then you died
<|endoftext|>

yesterday white and blue sails pretty on the water
sharp glint of skyscraper glass
then this derecho
<|endoftext|>

for a moment it is something that stays with me like a memory
that does not give up easily
i try wiping my hands onto my jeans but nothing
<|endoftext|>

all winter we slept benched together
breakers sleepdrunk children in a car
not conscious where they go
<|endoftext|>

we kneaded bread kept out the weather
while old suspicions huddled by the door
mice in the snow
<|endoftext|>

on the floor and hear the clink of silverware the stars their distant
speaking and picture the ceiling the back of a woman kneeling
covering the heart and holding up the bed and roof and cooling sky
<|endoftext|>

powerful disobedient
inside their draughty haberdasher's climate
with these people
<|endoftext|>

and not for the waterpools would i go back
the great muscle of my heart
to thirst like a drunkard for the scent-storm of the trees
<|endoftext|>

water mirrors house with high
green door opening out (no
steps) into pure air
<|endoftext|>

i have lived it and lived it
my nervous luxury civilisation
my sugar-loving nerves have battered me to pieces
<|endoftext|>

madness
on my bad days (and i'm being broken
at this very moment) i speak of my ambitions
<|endoftext|>

i grow coarser and more modern (i who am driven mad
by my ideas who go nowhere
who dare not leave my frontdoor lest an idea
<|endoftext|>

go to the cinema
i particularly like it when the fog is thick the street
is like a hole in an old coat and the light is brown as laudanum
<|endoftext|>

is somewhere else in his dead bedroom clothes
he wants to make me think his thoughts
to keep away from
<|endoftext|>

swollen drums
they had gravel underfoot
and tongues that could peel citrus
<|endoftext|>

radios throbbed
the wet hush
of my breath flung itself to mother
<|endoftext|>

i spied everything
the north dakota license
the baby on board signs dead raccoons and deer carcasses
<|endoftext|>

i was single-minded in the buzz saw tour i took through
the flatlands of the country to get home
i just wanted to get there
<|endoftext|>

how can i say this more clearly
it was like opening a heavy book
letting the pages feather themselves and finding a dried flower
<|endoftext|>

so if you speak only to
imagined beings
what does only mean
<|endoftext|>

a way to spend an afternoon back when an afternoon
needed spending
before all the silence flooded the house
<|endoftext|>

none of the streets here has a name
but if i'm lost
tonight i'm happy to be lost
<|endoftext|>

monument to the fact
that no one can hurt you no one kill you
like your own people
<|endoftext|>

but may you never go through what we went through
may you never see what we saw
may you never remember amp may you never forget
<|endoftext|>

by the river years ago recursive in memory a
finite moment the past ended
future began
<|endoftext|>

the river flowed south
you were a man's face
floating among stones
<|endoftext|>

by a river in autumn willow leaves were yellow
whisks in updrafts
we were not alone
<|endoftext|>

the river sounded the swish of its name
you
waded the neosho as it meandered east
<|endoftext|>

no one saw flood-seined silt gravel broken
mussel pearls
i stayed you left
<|endoftext|>

by the river i was a child i am grown
i remember
water pooled not moving
<|endoftext|>

live jazz at el fresco is one guy electric plinks
until he turns off the switch closes his eyes
and warbles a boy's tenor wood-flute tones

mikey's cursing again

a clamor in the distance
a crowd running under the rain beating
down between the canvases the sea wind set clattering
<|endoftext|>

i took refuge in a museum
outside the great wind mixed with
water reigns alone from now on shaking the glass panes
<|endoftext|>

on the night of a beautiful lunar eclipse
the silhouettes smiled
translated from the japanese

growing going
in drought or monsoon mold or blight
what is the rice if not alive

snow explodes like sugar
that someone is stabbing with a spoon

why i'm going to the taklamakan desert
at seventy-five leaving all words behind: the cry
of the emptiness there
<|endoftext|>

there in the taklamakan desert
the silence of a thousand-year-old skull
translated from the korean

but in fact i haven't even touched
you
at least not yet

i look up

and find instead    a flawed theorem

heavy translucent vaporous
split red by mother tongues
winter's breath is pink

i'm taking this back to my perfect desk
said the hg
this is really something

and coming back at night we get on too
quickening to the safety lights through
shadows of gates that thrust across the grit

the baby sleeps
sunlight plays upon my lap through doily leaves a black lab comes
a scotty goes the day wears on the baby wakes

white soot descends

eyelids fall softly from their gritted corners
chalk let it drizzle stinging flank heifers in their shove and jostle down a bank drinking behind the curtains billowing with images how the unseeable dispersing into folds slung aloft in sea mist impermissible point i breathe i look i carry forward i can sense the last of you taking o rail
i hate the thick floor beneath breathe over a market quarrel let the vault branch recklessly light-streams maze air's stirring giving what-for to earth seeming to attenuate rock is marked fans across the inlet a white shadow writes over deep-set floor

human meanness ruined
we were always waiting too long to let ourselves be seen

meditate on the spiritual
then go a little further if you feel like it
what is out there

forgive your country every once in a while
if that is not possible go
to another one
<|endoftext|>

appreciate simple pleasures such as the pleasure of chewing the
pleasure of warm water running down your back the pleasure of a
cool breeze the pleasure of falling asleep
<|endoftext|>

be calm in a crisis
the more critical the situation the calmer you
should be

enjoy sex but don't become obsessed with it
except for brief periods
in your adolescence youth middle age and old age
<|endoftext|>

answer letters promptly
use attractive stamps like the one with a
tornado on it
<|endoftext|>

remember beauty which exists and truth which does not
notice
that the idea of truth is just as powerful as the idea of beauty
<|endoftext|>

visit friends and acquaintances in the hospital
when you feel it is
time to leave do so
<|endoftext|>

when asked what you would like to drink
say water please

see shadow puppet plays and imagine that you are one of the
characters

now i flail
the wrong item creaks up
on the mental dumbwaiter
<|endoftext|>

the impossibile replication of weight
versus time
how it will never mean what you want
<|endoftext|>

everywhere is k-town everywhere is armeniatown
everywhere a little italy
less confederacy
<|endoftext|>

in my california free sounds and free touch
free questions free answers
free songs from parents and poets those hopeful bodies of light
<|endoftext|>

the storm
turns off
the lights
<|endoftext|>

the lightning
lights the whereabouts
of the flashlight
<|endoftext|>

the flashlight
takes us to matches
and candles the oil lamp
<|endoftext|>

now we're back
revisiting
the th century

when i was green and blossomed in the spring
i was mute wood
now i am dead i sing

second aunt said it was more realistic this way
god not in heaven
but in exile
<|endoftext|>

me that
had a

<|endoftext|>

here is the spot where she found human bones in the well
of her childhood home and how her mother told her
don't be afraid because it was not the work of wild animals
<|endoftext|>

god said men have forgotten me
the souls that sleep shall wake again
and blinded eyes must learn to see

miracle of the children   the brilliant

there were five
dropt dead beside me in the trench and three
whispered their dying messages to me

there where five
dropt dead beside me in the trench and three
whispered their dying messages to me
<|endoftext|>

a fox scat with hair and a tooth in it
a shellmound
a bone flake in a streambank
<|endoftext|>

sometimes i sit in my blue chair trying to remember
what it was like in the spring of
before the burning coal entered my life
<|endoftext|>

bestow the sacrament
their sins are not well known
ours to the four winds of the earth are blown
<|endoftext|>

no one kneads us again out of earth and clay
no one incants our dust
no one
<|endoftext|>

a short life and a merry one my buck
we used to say we'd hate to live dead-old
yet now
<|endoftext|>

when i had no eyes i listened
when i had no ears i thought
when i had no thought i waited

groping along the tunnel step by step
he winked his prying torch with patching glare
from side to side and sniffed the unwholesome air
<|endoftext|>

why you can hear the guns
hark
thud thud thud quite soft
<|endoftext|>

something is diffused
in whatever world he comes again
there will be women like us who choose to
<|endoftext|>

an officer came blundering down the trench
stand-to and man the fire step
on he went
<|endoftext|>

down and down and down he sank and drowned
bleeding to death
the counter-attack had failed
<|endoftext|>

there we would go my friend of friends and i
and snatch long moments from the grudging wars
whose dark made light intense to see them by
<|endoftext|>

the staff is working with its brains
while we are sitting in the trench
the staff the universe ordains
<|endoftext|>

such such is death: no triumph: no defeat
only an empty pail a slate rubbed clean
a merciful putting away of what has been
<|endoftext|>

mz n wondered
went home
and discovered a new octave
<|endoftext|>

this was another example
of mz n bringing up topics
that went nowhere
<|endoftext|>

we pile rocks on terracing love
carry the pithy cloth
to cover the hearths of our mother
<|endoftext|>

my shores reeled and rolled
to the world's end where they say
at the world's end the graves are green
<|endoftext|>

sick of being decent he craves another
crash
what reaches him except disaster

we look for new homes every day
for new altars we strive to rebuild
the old shrines defiled by the weaver's excrement

the more he talked the more she burned
and sighed and tossed and groaned and turned
at last i wish said she my dear
<|endoftext|>

from cobwebs ghosts sift through floorboards
and the homeless sleep in compost steeping like tea bags
pungent from the leaves' damp weight
<|endoftext|>

could mean both things: i'd do
nothing i'd promised not to
also there is nothing i'll forget
<|endoftext|>

which is only the sound
of a word for wind
then only the sound of wind
<|endoftext|>

a certain kindness to that hill its slope gone gaily green against the eve and oh the tail dipped the string slipped
uppity huff and drag of hawk air plundering eggs in the sparrow's nest
you left this fragment this bit of shell behind
<|endoftext|>

like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quay
plastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dolls
through which the current chortles an intimate tune
<|endoftext|>

a grey sky trawls its silver wires of rain
these are the subtleties of the noon sea
lime emerald lilac cobalt ultramarine
<|endoftext|>

when i press summer dusks together it is
a month of street accordions and sprinklers
laying the dust small shadows running from me
<|endoftext|>

there is the hudson like the sea aflame
i would undress you in the summer heat
and laugh and dry your damp flesh if you came
<|endoftext|>

and cries from a swallow
remind us one swallow
doesn't make a summer
<|endoftext|>

i admire her but wish she wouldn't idolize
the one who bullies her
i once did that
<|endoftext|>

the old man sipping coffee
in st

colonel shaw
is riding on his bubble
he waits
<|endoftext|>

up above his painted ceiling
baby mouse's skeleton
crumbles in the mouse's trap
<|endoftext|>

clinging to my fingers only
pain like glitter bits adhering
when i touch the shining crumbs
<|endoftext|>

from undergrowth amp over odd birds call
and who would starv'd so survive
god save the king
<|endoftext|>

so the particular judgement might be set
bare wallstead and a cold hearth rained into
bright puddle where the soul-free cloud-life roams
<|endoftext|>

and after the commanded journey what
nothing magnificent nothing unknown
a gazing out from far away alone
<|endoftext|>

touch the crossbeam drive iron in a wall
hang a line to verify the plumb
from lintel coping-stone and chimney-breast
<|endoftext|>

relocate the bedrock in the threshold
take squarings from the recessed gable pane
make your study the unregarded floor
<|endoftext|>

the annals say: when the monks of clonmacnoise
were all at prayers inside the oratory
a ship appeared above them in the air
<|endoftext|>

open now as the eye of heaven was then
above three sisters talking talking steady
in a boat the ground still falls and falls from under
<|endoftext|>

fathomableness ultimate
stony up-againstness: could you reconcile
what was diaphanous there with what was massive
<|endoftext|>

a phenomenal instant when the spirit flares
with pure exhilaration before death
the good thief in us harking to the promise
<|endoftext|>

she taught me what her uncle once taught her
how easily the biggest coal block split
if you got the grain and hammer angled right

on cuban farms even death

music

his instep has shrunk
cold as a swan's foot
or a wet swamp root
<|endoftext|>

think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily
like a dog looking for a place to sleep in
listen to it growling
<|endoftext|>

think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
all stuck in rows suddenly revealed
as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons
<|endoftext|>

now the storm goes away again in a series
of small badly lit battle-scenes
each in another part of the field
<|endoftext|>

think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge
think of him as uninjured barely disturbed
<|endoftext|>

i sat all morning in the college sick bay
counting bells knelling classes to a close
at two o'clock our neighbours drove me home
<|endoftext|>

in the porch i met my father crying
he had always taken funerals in his stride
and big jim evans saying it was a hard blow
<|endoftext|>

in my california kindergarten class
the teacher scolds me: real trees
don't look like that
<|endoftext|>

they have never seen
the dancing plants
of cuba
<|endoftext|>

i made that
i killed that
i
<|endoftext|>

this should be memorable
legs whited out
the runners advance
<|endoftext|>

their slaves from centuries back
were still black and their queen
was in english exile
<|endoftext|>

it's not my grace that keeps me erect
as the sidewalk clatters downhill
under my rollerskate wheels
<|endoftext|>

pried her mouth open and spit in it
we pass these things on
probably because we are what we can imagine
<|endoftext|>

whatever we wanted whenever  as in the fairy tale
on the beach
at marazion the surf is spangled with mackerel scales
<|endoftext|>

the feather on the egg is the horse under the bed
the new england winter is still raw and long
the summer is intense and abandoned
<|endoftext|>

so come on to hell with it let's go eat weeds
eat the flesh and fruit of our stupid
tears and moans of our pickled melancholy souls
<|endoftext|>

of silences that pouring through my head
surround roaring barking human muttering
is any of that what being sounds like
<|endoftext|>

or is it just animal gasping like what
jesus must have heard from the thieves
hanging beside him one damned one saved
<|endoftext|>

what was in his heart when his vision
clarified and he saw it was a hand he
recognized that the nail was driving through
<|endoftext|>

a diaphanous fog of adjectives overcomes me
jane says: i can't believe you said that in alabama
nothing stands in the way of my recklessness
<|endoftext|>

feeling filthy no matter the shift
or stiffness in the bones creaking
like the wooden stairs he climbed
<|endoftext|>

slingshotting around
there's gravity
for you but all i ever wanted was to fly
<|endoftext|>

he knows but what the garden gives
the garden's soot
awakened tongueless in root
<|endoftext|>

the wind called to the trees
and then it happened
and they said how do you feel
<|endoftext|>

and i said like a fountain
night falls from my neck like silver arrows
very gently
<|endoftext|>

and why not
my brain has been
hungry all this time
<|endoftext|>

and up in the dusk there is lucid debris
a conduit a wire mask a swastika
of corn
<|endoftext|>

boy- and/or girl-small we'll find
some horizon an intricate faking
in which to lose way
<|endoftext|>

to what do we owe this
forgetting not to kiss
not that any given face is not afraid
<|endoftext|>

face your waste of time
this is all
this is all you are
<|endoftext|>

to this urn let those repair
that are either true or fair
for these dead birds sigh a prayer
<|endoftext|>

panicky masks we wore for
effect more than effect
more real than we'd admit
<|endoftext|>

erst
while ecstatics' lapsed enchantment trance
gone none could say since when
<|endoftext|>

voice laryngitic lost
and lost again blown grit rubbed it
away
<|endoftext|>

choric strain
repeatedly slipped entablature
given
<|endoftext|>

we were there and somewhere else no
matter where we were everywhere more
than where we were
<|endoftext|>

slick
stick
people tricky soul a sick thing they said
<|endoftext|>

no longer point less point than
point's target stick city made them one and the
same

the unkempt beard of the fearsome mullah
overwhelms the two aging poets from the periphery
the far-flung provinces of iran and iraq
<|endoftext|>

blunt bayonets once sharp as wind
moon-pale stacks of clavicle
a hand
<|endoftext|>

my sister can sit on her hair
at night a man sits on her bed
her bed is covered in oak leaves
<|endoftext|>

the telephone bursts from the wall
the wires are a joke
we get it
<|endoftext|>

slowly in the hot air they swung three girls
how old were they
of marriageable age certainly
<|endoftext|>

see how the monsoon winds soar and shunt
tropic air into a house of souls
a doorway stopped by clouds
<|endoftext|>

set your feet into broken stones
and this red earth and pouring rain
for us there is no exile
<|endoftext|>

smackdab midchest you feel lumpy empty
sniff
sniff
<|endoftext|>

to flirt with you can
no longer flirt with
thank goodness
<|endoftext|>

focus on the shapes
cirrus a curl
stratus a layer cumulus a heap
<|endoftext|>

i packed up my sagas my song lyrics
my alchemy potions my gold and
i disappeared

kurosawa was a moralist
it is said he took and gently bent
akutagawa's grove
<|endoftext|>

with a long bark mules metered the distance and turned back
dust rose like columns of unpaid debt
spit dried before it could reach the ground
<|endoftext|>

the winner's body itself was an apple with skin chewed off
inside her breasts milk circled like a growling animal
locked behind two heavy nipples
<|endoftext|>

it was both day and night
her moon-white hand on the sun-gold fruit
in her hair more stones than in a graveyard
<|endoftext|>

lesson of the day: syria and styria
for syria read: his conquering banner shook from syria
and for styria: look at this harp of blood mapping
<|endoftext|>

pay attention to the skirmish  the white
panther that flitters up the pole
its shade grows large on the ground
<|endoftext|>

why write in prose what you could write as easily
as
poetry
<|endoftext|>

every poem must have distinct frames devices motifs styles forms or
concepts
poetry emasculates prose

an umayyad monk
spins wheat and wool above us
time is a scarecrow
<|endoftext|>

it's a good place for a party
he concurs
to friends now dressed in jeans
<|endoftext|>

he feels the warmth
and doesn't know his soul is filled
with the spirit of coyotes past
<|endoftext|>

if you hate to think about this shit because
why the fuck is it always on you
to preprove your loyalty and innocence
<|endoftext|>

they did not intend to fade out to the sound of bells and choiring
they would find a new woodland or water for haunt untroubled
by candles and books and the tedious meaningless latin
<|endoftext|>

the gods who had brought him were gone
he started counting
day one was the day when things began to go
<|endoftext|>

beyond
the stucco portal
crushed purple
<|endoftext|>

awoke and did their painful business
i let the city drop upon the stones
it split to its deep palaces and combs
<|endoftext|>

blood throbbed in the hurt veins
as if an unseen swarm mined there
the nest oozed bitter honey
<|endoftext|>

i swaddled my fat hand in cotton
after a week pain gave it back to me
scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin
<|endoftext|>

into the landfill before building crews
came their guitars amp harmonicas
chasing away ghosts at lunch break
<|endoftext|>

i argue
you want love
do you even know what it looks like smells like

he set it on the table the way people on television
set things when they're afraid those things might blow-up
or go-off  he set it right next to my empty coffee cup
<|endoftext|>

it was no ark
it was the broken end of a picture frame
with a floral design carved into its surface
<|endoftext|>

my brother  teeming with shadows
a hull of bones lit only by tooth and tusk
lifting his ark high in the air
<|endoftext|>

a carpet of light the
ocean alive lt half a moon
muting the stars
<|endoftext|>

to those who kiss in fear that they shall never kiss again
to those that love with fear that they shall never love again
to such i dedicate this rhyme and what it may contain

he said look
look
and they did

done with junior to help him
we painted our rooms
cinnamon aegean blue repainted them eggshell gris-perle

or worse called ugly a cruel joke
or
there are always worse things
<|endoftext|>

have i spent too much time worrying about the boys
killing each other to pray for the ones who do it
with their own hands
<|endoftext|>

an encore
of boy after boy
after sweet boy   their endless bloody bow
<|endoftext|>

only you tenderness
stillborn beneath
the skin of sleep

she pressed her ear against the shell
she wanted to hear everything
he never told her

a city of silence
risen out of desert
built of bodies
<|endoftext|>

had brought the obliterated back
not again (i said
from my second-floor room

is it yours
her gold eye-teeth gleamed

as if i were
licking him thin

the counter and draws fire from sarge to
begin the fight up and down the wide screen
of memory ablaze in warner-color light

our problem was preparation
premeditation
neutered any rage potential

house this morning is pale with the rush of what night siphoned off
objects still emptied of resemblance hum their chord-less cantos
bloodless my knuckles knock on walls without echo testing singularities
<|endoftext|>

a dandelion's root far deeper
tolerant of drought and poor soil
is not an easily uprooted presence
<|endoftext|>

the radio saying run run run
milkflower petals on a black dog
like pieces of a girl's dress
<|endoftext|>

don't worry he says as the first bomb brightens
their faces my brothers have won the war
and tomorrow

he is fraught as angel clare
with honesty with his latchet
worthy of her

what i remember
is the smooth arc the gun made amp the way
jesus shimmied to the rhythm
<|endoftext|>

first architect of the jungle amp author of pastel slums
patron saint of rust
you have become too famous to be read
<|endoftext|>

i let the book fall behind me until it becomes
a book again
cloth thread  amp the infinite wood
<|endoftext|>

but of whom
brecht gasping for air in the street
truman dancing alone with his daughter
<|endoftext|>

and this confetti on which our history is being written
smaller amp smaller less clear every moment
and subject to endless revision
<|endoftext|>

no
no hunh
no
<|endoftext|>

time to recount the sparrows of the air
seated alone on an elected stair
i stare as they appear and disappear
<|endoftext|>

tonight the deck supports tremendous quiet
although the twilight is itself a riot
i'm glad i'm staying here not at the hyatt
<|endoftext|>

my pen eye notes watch whiskey glass and hell
all hang together comfortably well
pain is my favorite resort hotel
<|endoftext|>

put them in a little boat called
she who must be obeyed
our little joke
<|endoftext|>

then in the august of my twenty-seventh year
naked except for my seaclogs
i greeted an audience of piers
<|endoftext|>

after my dip i came up covered
in salt and sand: hair tough as an angel's
who could disappoint me now among the so-coifed
<|endoftext|>

camp is over and the children come out
wearing hats the children are happy for each other
each camp having been maximally appropriate
<|endoftext|>

beef: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us and is for some arc
fully quiet
<|endoftext|>

i need help moving my chickens
i need help with girl problem
my dog like keeps marking the wrong areas
<|endoftext|>

lobster trap elegies
the way a hung coat suggests a general's death
on the banks of the monongahela and dinner guests toreadors
<|endoftext|>

everything birthing its vanishing point
even the sycamore
which is to say even the man is due to be shot skinned and tanned
<|endoftext|>

cooling sheds phrenology
moose racks buckets
the smoothness of a plank box and the irregularity of hay
<|endoftext|>

i think it's very cold there
i think andrew loves
his wife: her posture beneath a flat-crowned hat
<|endoftext|>

a streak of sun climbed the rough
trunk of a tree but he did not
see it with his open eye
<|endoftext|>

a shadow in the shape of a house
slides out of a house
and loses its shape on the lawn

she'll have got to the mantis eggs by now
at each gulp of hatchling
she slowly blinks with satisfaction
<|endoftext|>

follow where all is
/ follow the transfused
/ follow what is still and what is still-attracting
<|endoftext|>

she pointed out that i had not made eye contact
with her at all
then i cried properly in a short burst
<|endoftext|>

let butter and chocolate be a wish not to die
i implored the bain-marie
she likened me to a sieve
<|endoftext|>

i clutch all my poems to my chest and count them
again and again
i am kneeling like a small dog
<|endoftext|>

how much bigger though
when i say
i've had enough how will you know when to stop
<|endoftext|>

firmer still a melee awkwardness that showed all registrants just
how we managed to pickpocket night
then came dark crowds
<|endoftext|>

modern territories click like a mouse
body becomes human body
on a skinny avenue i hushed up pyramidal steps older than sorcery
<|endoftext|>

picnics bended over they happen below
swings parks rung
i inject chlorine into my memory-parts with lady satisfaction
<|endoftext|>

are you gay
a political campaign sanctioned a quart of moose
so stars soon quarreled back to the travel section of the north
<|endoftext|>

the positional plot warps but is the same
the deluxe mattress drifts
on gravitational subtleties like the rest of us practicing the gut's banjo
<|endoftext|>

no in fact i don't know how he ever crossed the channels or canals
from that stout city
i don't really know if i ever really need to know
<|endoftext|>

a furnace's windup huffing
in this throat
clearing of snow
<|endoftext|>

when pungent or cruel they sauce the ache
light folds them in two
what i want to say is i would meet you upon this
<|endoftext|>

that was the sedgy day invisible contagions
stretching from our roof
on which the fresh trails of spilled pink
<|endoftext|>

i fall in love
the things
the wind is telling me
<|endoftext|>

i fall in love
how they wear
their strange amp double-eyes
<|endoftext|>

i'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you
autumn encircles a confusion that's nothing new
flash back to warring eyes almost letting me drown
<|endoftext|>

and i'm in the barricade hearing the clock thickening you
clematis enclosures walking with news pollinated by a
secondary grief while something reminds you of our love
<|endoftext|>

i wish i had left the same way
but i brought with me all my belongings
even my army mug and a bunch of old letters
<|endoftext|>

and how do you survive
your long throat
your red-rag-to-a-bull head
<|endoftext|>

rain fell as a glass
breaks
something suddenly everywhere at the same time
<|endoftext|>

you if no one else
will condemn with your tongue
the erosion each disappointment brings
<|endoftext|>

i see the body with its own career of gestures
its bright roads its dark roads
apart serene
<|endoftext|>

trapped in one chained line
one terrifying combination of arrangements
driven to taste each other's flesh
<|endoftext|>

near the old and lost river they surmised
spanish moss strains coffee pretty good
they sang green green grass of home
<|endoftext|>

a dollar is peeled off a roll of thousands
it is the day the mint of it is in my mouth
i open it completely fresh
<|endoftext|>

when you put down the book you will come when you
hear the words put down the book
you will come when you hear
<|endoftext|>

which of you knows how not to part the pebble on the beach from its colors
the songbird from its social network
the fruit from its multifaceted peel
<|endoftext|>

and each seed-bearing fruit has an atmosphere
each has its several moons
has tides  changing weather lunar eclipses

that she has been taken
to the wrong place
<|endoftext|>

that the room

if you mock us pan
in whom we also believe do it
as gently as you can
<|endoftext|>

i had the happy idea that someday i would find both pleasure and punishment that i would
know them and feel them
and that until i did it would be almost as good to pretend
<|endoftext|>

i had the happy idea that what i do not understand is more real than what i do
and then the happier idea to buckle myself
into two blue velvet shoes
<|endoftext|>

and clicked each lucky one
and one
until i was happily undone
<|endoftext|>

still bride of your own armor
bride of your own blind eyes
this isn't an appeal
<|endoftext|>

resumed
some nights i paint into the scene two doves
i being alternately one and then the other calling myself by my kind
<|endoftext|>

and the wool was pulled
over as cover
no eyes were kept peeled

he downed the bead: her true form a nine-tailed
fox who could have turned human had he kissed on

whatever party fame's doing to her
chances for a quick trial
barbarella can't touch her goldilocks
<|endoftext|>

i wish she could have a single day of  language
so that i might reassure her don't be afraid
our whole world is dead and so can do you no harm
<|endoftext|>

fell to the bottom of fathoms became black
slick hid in shale
they drill down miles
<|endoftext|>

some music   some shelling
will strike our dead    who flew off in the early raids
have you seen them   return from their flying
<|endoftext|>

the heat compounded and ugliness
settled its cloud over us profound as human speech
although by then we were not speaking
<|endoftext|>

and i hear the crows complaint complaint
splitting the morning hunched over the skull
they know their offices
<|endoftext|>

grown-ups keep their feet on the ground
when they swing
i hate that
<|endoftext|>

don't talk big to me
i'm carrying my box of faces
if i want to change faces i will
<|endoftext|>

i'll invite a bee to live in your shoe
what if you found your shoe
full of honey
<|endoftext|>

what if the clock said
instead of
would you be scared
<|endoftext|>

in this poem all artifice
is stripped away
but you are held under water
<|endoftext|>

instead of a dog barking there was silence
then the sound of a drum beaten loud amp fast
by a young nun
<|endoftext|>

maybe he could drift through the crush of lookers
in cigarette smoke in the breath of many lungs
common innocuous a cloud about to disappear
<|endoftext|>

in the broad yard
each thing dandles
its blue its name its consequence
<|endoftext|>

i want to travel far amp then return
the wind blows as if i were eighty-five
maybe eighty-seven
<|endoftext|>

and so alone
un-alone even in my anger
bring you here
<|endoftext|>

counting feels just as impossible
as turning solid mountains
into a ditch
<|endoftext|>

i'll shower with you but i'm leaving
my underwear on and you enjoyed her
in every way you could enjoy a person with soap
<|endoftext|>

you didn't join your wife in the shower
she's gotten funny about letting you see her
shave her legs or wash herself anywhere
<|endoftext|>

i know
my big mouth
full of their light
<|endoftext|>

avoid the hive mind
go fly a kite
raise a stained glass window in the sky
<|endoftext|>

in pieces
let me collect its dna
from the tears on your desk
<|endoftext|>

the water's not too cold
it doesn't feel
like being dead
<|endoftext|>

do we seem rootless
holding fast to the anchor
of the saddest things
<|endoftext|>

in her focus-wrinkled brow for a living
today
i think i practice the religion of blinking too much
<|endoftext|>

there are many opportunities here for unrequited friendship
the offer letter said
all you need is a chain saw and die grinder
<|endoftext|>

into making us
the thing we want
to call beautiful
<|endoftext|>

my hands feel like scorpion claws
clamped on to a hard hard shovel all day
then curled into fists at night
<|endoftext|>

sorrow's a barbaric art crude as a viking ship or a child
who rode a spotted pony to the lake away from summer
in the s  toward the iron lung of polio
<|endoftext|>

today i bring an actual-size sunrise and many glow words
from the inmates of this late-stage civilization who navigate
in your slipstream and to whom you say keep rowing
<|endoftext|>

ain't no lightness of hand but of bounce player
constraints imposed by a corvid named jim
could not interpret my remedies
<|endoftext|>

jim wasn't much of a macgyver
not one skill in therapeutic thaumaturgy
he prescribed cowlicks for the heartsick: i mean really
<|endoftext|>

t-bone hit it straight for
cause the planets were so aligned
sho'nuf heard these arcane words precise
<|endoftext|>

comes in georgia peach flavor
too much will turn your guts like
entheogen
<|endoftext|>

dare to transpose any other energy drink sookie
this exhumation bears no map
fore the next internment there shall be no other
<|endoftext|>

we will watch the first grader with little cymbals
bending her knees hunched in concentration
while neighbors snicker at her ardent face
<|endoftext|>

we lower its silken ceiling
to graze his dark hair
repeat the prayer
<|endoftext|>

only white people swim in lakes nowadays
you know
crystal lake
<|endoftext|>

abandoned tires relics of its sewer days river herring spark no fear
and a publicly funded park with a biology class a boat-making workshop
for the children of hunt's point gives me hope we'd wet our hair again
<|endoftext|>

a sporty new aged convenience
a luxury to admire when long beach is too far
and rockaway too dirty
<|endoftext|>

till everyone got it off by heart
every start was a bad start
since all conclusions were foregone
<|endoftext|>

every wood had its twist of woodbine
every cliff its herd of fatalistic swine
every runnel was a rubicon
<|endoftext|>

it walks out the door with my legs
through the gate
headed straight for the racetrack
<|endoftext|>

blocks with the waxed blade lifted
and tossed lifted and tossed again
squaring off against the snow
<|endoftext|>

we didn't like each other
but lynn's mother had died
and my father had died
<|endoftext|>

lynn's father didn't know how to talk to her
my mother didn't know how to talk to me
and lynn and i didn't know how to talk either
<|endoftext|>

hit publish and look away
the new violence: i visited a country where
everything looked like home
<|endoftext|>

it had to be from someone who didn't exist
before this poem
began writing itself down
<|endoftext|>

am: the frogs
ask what is it what is it
it is what it is
<|endoftext|>

my mother sends me a black-and-white
photograph of  her and my father circa
posing with two indian men
<|endoftext|>

who are those indian guys
i ask her
on the phone
<|endoftext|>

farther than our hero santiago can see
i rise in the night to find the sharp knife
that came with the pears as a courtesy
<|endoftext|>

five of  them later scarfing the oak's
black bole
laying a dream of snakes
<|endoftext|>

the pause
the lean in
the reveal
<|endoftext|>

yes i live inside the piano
but there is no need for you
to come and visit me
<|endoftext|>

smiling
to cold air i slept under a bear skin
touched your lips in the night
<|endoftext|>

in time we cut through the ice sank
fathoms into the sea chaperoned by seals
that are not mermaids at all
<|endoftext|>

i sing the beauty of bodily touch
with my muse blue grace
spring
<|endoftext|>

coyote girls in myth-time
at the central dream of edenic treasures
the irrevocable annihilation of christian civilization is taking shape with carnivorous flowers of volcanic thought
<|endoftext|>

i thought jack abramoff was my buddy
a small fish with a large chicken
what a dick
<|endoftext|>

doesn't anyone care about my feelings
all i wanted to do was kill little birds
because you know that's fun
<|endoftext|>

goosedown a thistle fluff naked and
hatless unaccounted for and extra
the world like a world like a world
<|endoftext|>

farewell to you my hopes my wonted waking dreams
farewell self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth
and farewell friendship's sacred league uniting minds of worth
<|endoftext|>

you better hope you never see angels on the rez
if you do they'll be marching you off to
zion or oklahoma or some other hell they've mapped out for us
<|endoftext|>

my brothers and sisters were giddy shredding
his stained t-shirts and raggedy pants throwing them up
into the air like confetti
<|endoftext|>

a few stray dogs came to the window
i heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom
<|endoftext|>

i brought up the pots and pans and spoons
banged them
together like a new year's day celebration
<|endoftext|>

i seen the troops shoot people
they ride around with guns
almost like we was in a prison camp
<|endoftext|>

no the place wasn't on fire
it was some children upstairs
playing with the fire extinguisher
<|endoftext|>

like hell
and like i said i never in my life grew up in a house
with millions of people
<|endoftext|>

two hours later they drop us water
and half of it burst open
cause they was so high up when they dropped it
<|endoftext|>

the news got us out
not the national guard not the mayor not blanco
the news people is the only ones who got us out
<|endoftext|>

channel got me out
channel
the rest of them was there to kill us
<|endoftext|>

i got tired of convention centers
i wanted
to come the hell up out of that damn convention center
<|endoftext|>

born on monday and a tiny
world-containing grain of light
passed through each eye like heaven through a needle
<|endoftext|>

he rolled on wednesday rolled his whole body
full of immense salt spaces slowly
from one horizon to the other
<|endoftext|>

and on saturday he tested a footstep
and the sky came down and alit on his shoulder
full of various languages in which one bird doesn't answer to another
<|endoftext|>

and on sunday he dreamed he was flying
and his mind grew gold watching the moon
and he began to sing to the brink of speaking
<|endoftext|>

i am watching the movie twelve angry men
because there is a character in it
who reminds me of him
<|endoftext|>

in the forest of  wearisome sadness
where one day i found myself wandering alone
i met my heart who called to me asking me where i was going
<|endoftext|>

it's not just this
every written word is a suicide note
and a love letter too
<|endoftext|>

if you are going there by foot prepare
to get wet
you are not you anymore
<|endoftext|>

while washing dishes with a bleeding hand
there's a line that cleaves things come apart
things join in wholes of which they are a part
<|endoftext|>

not what is your name
but what
the battle
<|endoftext|>

safe from the elements
protected from rust
and more esoteric forms of corrosion
<|endoftext|>

my father gave me a rosewood chess set when i turned twelve
and it probably wasn't love just a lucky last-minute guess
at the toy store which is probably what most love is anyway
<|endoftext|>

and she mortally threatened wholly unaware
that i do this daily alone with the gold last light
in what seems to me an act of love
<|endoftext|>

who are you
the king asks
it is not like that the seer says
<|endoftext|>

the seer leaves the king alone in his throne room
and starts walking to china kicking up gravel
hurrying to find the next king
<|endoftext|>

those flowers i've only heard of
to whatever there is and isn't
above
<|endoftext|>

what kind of delusion are you under
the life he hid just knocked you flat
you see the lightning but not the thunder
<|endoftext|>

what god hath joined let no man put asunder
did god know you'd marry a rat
what kind of delusion are you under
<|endoftext|>

his online persona simply stunned her
as it did you when you started to chat
you see the lightning but not the thunder
<|endoftext|>

to the victors go the plunder
you should crown them with a baseball bat
what kind of delusion are you under
<|endoftext|>

languishing yet at the very
bottom rung letting go my grip
long before the blessing
<|endoftext|>

how we huddled all night in our small house
moving between rooms
emptying pots filled with rain
<|endoftext|>

i want to live there someday across that street
and listen to him
yap yap yap
<|endoftext|>

as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep
and the doctor begins to burn
those summers away
<|endoftext|>

she's with grandma in front
of grandma's house backed
by a willow tree gladiola and roses
<|endoftext|>

no doubt mother frowns
behind the lens wants
to straighten this sassy face
<|endoftext|>

in fact you
couldn't prove
they're not
<|endoftext|>

it is summer
under our butter bread
summer's hunger satisfied
<|endoftext|>

penciled seagull in the margin
following line by line
the path you took i imagine no print so fine
<|endoftext|>

don't call it a failure call it knowledge
the peculiar taste that filled his mouth
as if  he had bitten his cheek
<|endoftext|>

whatever he risked did not matter whatever
he could imagine was already lost
bored the other boy coughed into his hands
<|endoftext|>

evening falls
someone's playing a dulcimer
its voice touches and parts the air of summer
<|endoftext|>

i'm moving from grief street
taxes are high here
though the mortgage's cheap
<|endoftext|>

when i throw them out
it may frighten you
and maybe me too
<|endoftext|>

a new embroidery of flowers canary color
dots the grass already dotty
with aster-white and clover
<|endoftext|>

how deep does that go
how do you know
do you think you're a seer
<|endoftext|>

him anymore
whatever
i'm all like
<|endoftext|>

we did speak like that
as if from a book of psalms
because it took up the sky
<|endoftext|>

no other church  though i don't know its rite
could so from head to epididymis
move me with deep devotion to its site
<|endoftext|>

these are the nights men run
guaymas before midday
a beach-town life
<|endoftext|>

i wear my heart on my sleeve
or rather both sleeves since
it's usually broken
<|endoftext|>

of the mares i will have left only early morning
who won't know that i will soon take her hide
turn it into an ocean that will at last cleave open my skull
<|endoftext|>

well that's memory for you that's so-called
civilization for you to layer up
to redo the already done
<|endoftext|>

something perverse about that
something perfectly fiendishly self-conscious about that
ask
<|endoftext|>

how can you
be in two places at once
when you're not anywhere at all
<|endoftext|>

fine
fuck it
start over
<|endoftext|>

they're not
that smart anyhow a stage-whispering drunk from the back
of our imperial realm mile  the park road
<|endoftext|>

have at it
please explain
please fill in this blank
<|endoftext|>

the spirit leans
intrigued the other part bored then there's want
then there's wait
<|endoftext|>

thus begins the beef between bird and bee
the isthmus isolating
order from chaos
<|endoftext|>

of primped snakes
he thought
but it is the cold weight of scales that protects
<|endoftext|>

and when i tell frances i see she is a moon
motionless in the doorway skin reflecting
a lamp a face that awakens on paper
<|endoftext|>

yet an hour can have shape and proportion
four walls a ceiling
an hour can be dropped like a glass
<|endoftext|>

a chimney swift flits through the fumatorium
i long for one last blue democracy
which has broke my heart a while
<|endoftext|>

goodbye luck you idiot
said the fox to the grapes
i love you replied the grapes
<|endoftext|>

i know that rarity precedes extinction
like that of the purple orchid in my garden
whose sudden disappearance rattled me
<|endoftext|>

jane in her way is also beautiful
and therefore near extinction i suppose
she is certainly rare and fragile of bone
<|endoftext|>

she insists she is dying day by dubious day
and spends her evenings looking at photographs
of her mother who never believed in love
<|endoftext|>

i moved my chair into sun
i sat in the sun
the way hunger is moved when called fasting
<|endoftext|>

she said her vows near the shore where
the emigrants set down their consonantal n
on afternoon on the end of everything at the start of ever
<|endoftext|>

better to marry than to burn
she quotes
she don't know us
<|endoftext|>

in a precisely lighted room the cfo speaks
of start-to-start dependencies
says let me loop back with you
<|endoftext|>

still one table away
these two with gnarled empretzled hands
seem unhappy in the old way
<|endoftext|>

where half the people in your life have gone dissolving
your sense of time which was never supposed to have
an end
<|endoftext|>

he puts his tools away
one by one lays them out carefully
on the deal table his work done
<|endoftext|>

and this gulf of blues deep and shiny
the only place to be
between time and eternity
<|endoftext|>

what if  it were possible to vanquish
all this shame with a wash of  varnish
instead of wishing the stain would vanish
<|endoftext|>

what if  you gave it a glossy finish
what if  there were a way to burnish
all this foolishness all the anguish
<|endoftext|>

what if  you gave yourself  leave to ravish
all these ravages with famished relish
what if  this were your way to flourish
<|endoftext|>

what if  the self  you love to punish
knavish peevish wolfish sheepish
were all slicked up in something lavish
<|endoftext|>

what would be left if  you couldn't brandish
all the slavishness you've failed to banish
what would you be without this gibberish
<|endoftext|>

what if  the true worth of the varnish
were to replenish your resolve to vanquish
every vain wish before you vanish
<|endoftext|>

again today no miracles at hand
just in the field wrens who stab at milkweed pods
a nuthatch bargaining from its split branch
<|endoftext|>

barred light
dunes coming on
and on
<|endoftext|>

is losing itself
though the trees
are clearly limned
<|endoftext|>

to spirit up my mare
in every shape but those appear
which taste and nature wear
<|endoftext|>

i want only to admire the grass
the great locks of trees
that the idea is enough
<|endoftext|>

who is it that actually sees herself
the heart center of the fragrance
billowing toward its end
<|endoftext|>

and with tears put salt in these mythical tales
and with an arras weavers combe of box she fiercely smit
by sinking level with us l'enfant in the room
<|endoftext|>

thy matchless mercy i implore
when i must wake to sleep no more
in realms of endless being
<|endoftext|>

ca-ca
and we never even had the slightest
clue that che was camping out
<|endoftext|>

a circle
what was needed was a circuit
and a good operating system
<|endoftext|>

what's within is without being seen
to be so
optical anomaly as unexceptional
<|endoftext|>

four left's a square
one way turning system
until it becomes its other way
<|endoftext|>

a passive insistence on multiples
until that divorces itself
becomes single
<|endoftext|>

said well here opens his sits
at its bottom
the bodies
<|endoftext|>

the whey foam on the head
of the safest society in human
civilization
<|endoftext|>

amnesia to people
who will actually
harm and hurt
<|endoftext|>

my father came upon me once cross-legged on the floor
his sad smile telling me more than any detection
he took my hand and closed the door
<|endoftext|>

i throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket but
my aim is no good
the floor is scattered with fire hazards declarations unread
<|endoftext|>

hockey star amp cross-country runner
who sat at my lunch table
in high school
<|endoftext|>

jumped out of a greenwich village window
in
anne kepler
<|endoftext|>

killed by smoke-poisoning while playing
the flute at the yonkers children's hospital
during a fire set by a year old arsonist
<|endoftext|>

may she be refused in both heaven and hell
and wander the earth forever without rest
a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees
<|endoftext|>

it's your own
life you lean over greedy
going back for more
<|endoftext|>

the first one means: repeating or myriad
consisting of many parts increasing in number
happening over and over without end
<|endoftext|>

overnight a wall sprang up around him
leaving the rest of us
outside
<|endoftext|>

that kind of speed keeps a poet accountable
he won't ever say the grass is very green
when it's only green
<|endoftext|>

he lay still for an hour and a half
then reared up onto his rickety legs
like a newborn calf
<|endoftext|>

the anthology of love poems i bought
for a quarter is brittle anyway and comes
apart when i read it
<|endoftext|>

one at a time i throw pages on the fire
and watch smoke make its way up
and out
<|endoftext|>

i put on my blue jacket and join them
the children stand with their mouths
open
<|endoftext|>

all that is beautiful from which i choose
even artifice which i hold above nature
won't salve these stuttered accoutrements
<|endoftext|>

one hand said i will go where you go
while the other hand continued
on alone
<|endoftext|>

outside there's a world where every love scene
begins with a man in a doorway
he walks over to the woman and says open your mouth
<|endoftext|>

the heist gang dons clown masks and
sherry will betray george and johnny can't love fay
and the fortune in the suitcase just blows away
<|endoftext|>

bartender make it straight and make it three
one for the negro
one for you and me
<|endoftext|>

nearer the ground than townsend's solitaire
doctor nkomo
raked his hair
<|endoftext|>

this is just one of the things
i noticed about my thoughts
as they passed easefully by
<|endoftext|>

their clothes no longer fit
it was this that brought them
to me crying their faces twitching
<|endoftext|>

replies the frail
and faithful heart
it's not for sale
<|endoftext|>

last night in bed
i mouthed a prayer
of my own composition
<|endoftext|>

the pen is no mightier than the soul
never underestimate the nib of corruption
better late than suffer the long introduction
<|endoftext|>

we drop the shadows where they are then
return to them
when the light has grown heavy
<|endoftext|>

we've never been too sure that we exist as the earth does
we're most at home in water
that soaks up the letters in our brains
<|endoftext|>

the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room
while a pinned-up psyops leaflet declares
if you sleep in a cemetery you're bound to have nightmares
<|endoftext|>

a big hard-working hand anybody's
to come medicinally down antibody
to the slow infection of  her western face
<|endoftext|>

but time outbids all comers and we die
expensively in princess margaret
who was herself once so beautiful
<|endoftext|>

approach life as if it were a banquet
your rightful portion averts your ireful potion
caress what can't be blessed cup shadows under breasts
<|endoftext|>

let pass what's out of  ken: lover job riches
a ripe peach
until it reaches you
<|endoftext|>

but had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up
i might in the sigh and strike of the next night's bombs
have realized a little what they meant and for the first time been afraid
<|endoftext|>

sometimes you say something like even so boo
and it sounds like breathe darling
that's why this one's for you
<|endoftext|>

of lightning splits the sky
and a hammer of thunder pounds the earth
and the eagles and panthers cry
<|endoftext|>

only the fort remains near forty feet high
round unfinished half open to the sky
the elements wind rain god's deliberate eye
<|endoftext|>

i began to raise my head and noticed
for the first time the bunting
red white and blue hung out for the parade
<|endoftext|>

would you move just one inch over
there
the light was in my eye
<|endoftext|>

here is the photographer and his party
exploring the great canyons of the west
while their clothes dry on the line
<|endoftext|>

look for me under the hood
of that old chevrolet settled in weeds
at the end of the pasture
<|endoftext|>

i'm the radiator that spent its years
bolted in front of an engine
shoving me forward into the wind
<|endoftext|>

that which made abraham bare the priestly knife
and isaac kneel or that young hebrew girl
who sought her father coming from the strife
<|endoftext|>

soldiers we must fight and save
freedom now and give our foes
all their country should a grave
<|endoftext|>

house
the apple trees have taken over the sky
sequestered the gate sidled over the porch
<|endoftext|>

lit on the table the dried twigs
the autumn leaves in the blue chinese vase
thanks for the faces our faces in this low light
<|endoftext|>

this keeps the focus where it wants to be
on whom you ask
invariably on
<|endoftext|>

i didn't even have to say did i
i love you so much
no need to reply
<|endoftext|>

how my hardscrabble prayer
in it's dove's arc
was answered
<|endoftext|>

where'd you get that voice
refusing to come
to a particular point castration finally made sense
<|endoftext|>

the entries there make no mention of hell
which was sifted through the vale of tears  amp fell
to make earth  amp the base of this hill where i sunbathe amp murmur
<|endoftext|>

shut up be like a compass
the king
has erased your name from the book of speech
<|endoftext|>

i'm done
speak to me soul's soul's soul
from desire of whom from whose desire every throat was cut
<|endoftext|>

toward what we knew and did not know
we knew in the spreading twilight
that returns changed to a changed place
<|endoftext|>

i thought we were playing a game
in a forest that day
i ran as my mother chased me
<|endoftext|>

over the courses i travel from now on
what's that whisper
just the delicate sweeping away of somebody's life
<|endoftext|>

we're dear blood daughters to this every hag and near kin
to any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us
presuming us who are young to be beautiful kind and sure
<|endoftext|>

blood from a kitchen fresco in thick amber strokes
blood from the baby's right ear from his ochre nose
what blood is this
<|endoftext|>

it is blood time sir terminator says
it is blood time sir simpson winks
it is blood time sir mcveigh weighs
<|endoftext|>

blood on the wheel blood on the reel
bronze dead gold amp diamond deep
blood be fast
<|endoftext|>

amp all the while we found love in unlikely places: in
the ravaged church of our bodies amp our faces
refracted in their long faces
<|endoftext|>

amp at three he told me at my age he had red hair amp broke his neck falling off
a runaway horse i know
the rocking chair's set too close to the edge of the porch
<|endoftext|>

more than anything
when i speak of
the darkness i mean this living
<|endoftext|>

back then we slept watched tv
we were the dogs
by the time the screen door slammed we were gone
<|endoftext|>

to move the limbs of the body
to speak intelligible words
these things promise change
<|endoftext|>

away so that i could always  hold this concise image
of before  that  time  and it
floods  my memory
<|endoftext|>

they eat of me
of small and blemished apples in low fields of me
whose rocky streams and droughts i do not drink
<|endoftext|>

like a perfume
that does not choose the direction it travels
that cannot be straight or crooked kept out or kept
<|endoftext|>

gauley bridge is a good town for negroes they let us stand around they let us stand
around on the sidewalks if we're black or brown
vanetta's over the trestle and that's our town
<|endoftext|>

the hill makes breathing slow slow breathing after your row the river
and the graveyard's on the hill cold in the springtime blow
the graveyard's up on high and the town is down below
<|endoftext|>

did you ever bury thirty-five men in a place in back of your house
thirty-five tunnel workers the doctors didn't attend
died in the tunnel camps under rocks everywhere world without end
<|endoftext|>

when a man said i feel poorly for any reason any weakness or such
letting up when he couldn't keep going barely
the cap and company come and run him off the job surely
<|endoftext|>

when the blast went off the boss would call out come let's go back
when that heavy loaded blast went white come let's go back
telling us hurry hurry into the falling rocks and muck
<|endoftext|>

as dark as i am when i came out at morning after the tunnel at night
with a white man nobody could have told which man was white
the dust had covered us both and the dust was white
<|endoftext|>

instead i walk around in children's clothes
shorts and a t-shirt with the name of a band
lettered on the front announcing me to nobody
<|endoftext|>

like a boardinghouse table
men on one side women on the other
nobody planned it
<|endoftext|>

a man and a woman are like those rivers
entering a larger sea
greater than the sum of all its parts
<|endoftext|>

in the bathroom crayoned
graffiti
fuck the
<|endoftext|>

stand still and silent
pray
return
<|endoftext|>

with regards to your husband i am as
ever your loving father

<|endoftext|>

full of light and music the beating air
light like a bird calvino says not a feather
over the water the shags come in to land
<|endoftext|>

though once there were many of my kind
flocking inland or perhaps
it felt that way
<|endoftext|>

then laughs
it's okay kiddo
long as you're here you're one of us
<|endoftext|>

and things: a wishbone ring whatever i crave
the heart-hollows the cannot-do-withouts the whens
and whos the frayed veils between death and here
<|endoftext|>

love
a
minor
<|endoftext|>

i could make a wardrobe
with tufts of wool
caught on thistle and bracken
<|endoftext|>

down in minutes
within the month
an island silted up behind
<|endoftext|>

glove over glove let your dance express
what i've been creeping like a vein of sweat
through a vastness of
<|endoftext|>

hunger
is like the inside
biting you
<|endoftext|>

i don't know when i stopped believing in heaven
or if i do
maybe i just stopped receiving heaven
<|endoftext|>

we married in september
everyone was still
wearing their summer shirts sleeves of heaven
<|endoftext|>

it was white there was a bend and the car
spun
it was then i prayed pleading with heaven
<|endoftext|>

when he goes limp lie him down on the gurney
mom
oxygen mask breathing heaven
<|endoftext|>

he loves the colors of planets
i teach him
their lifelessness: beautiful deceiving heaven
<|endoftext|>

my drawing teacher said: look think make a mark
look i told myself
and waited to be marked
<|endoftext|>

but loss is a precious stone to me a nectar
distilled in time preaching the truth of winter
to the fallen heart that does not cease to fall
<|endoftext|>

mother and father
forgive me my absence
i will always be moving quietly toward you
<|endoftext|>

the old magic won't work now
but it's nice
to be reminded of it
<|endoftext|>

drops her petals
as if she could always
make more
<|endoftext|>

we know
what she looks like
naked
<|endoftext|>

how the realtor's lens makes everything look larger
and there's so much glare the floor looks wow
under the smartificial xmas tree
<|endoftext|>

after studying comparative reality
i began die polyvinylchloride tannenbaumserie
turn off that tiny tasteful star i commanded
<|endoftext|>

i know what you mean you said
it's like the time i was compelled to speak
on hedonism to the monks and nuns
<|endoftext|>

and tell me what creature what peril
could craft that sound that night
dropped like a nubile sliver in my ear
<|endoftext|>

there is no freedom of silence
when morture forces us to speak
from organs other than the heart
<|endoftext|>

see how it grows its own cross of fur
and bears it on its back
i showed you that
<|endoftext|>

here is a pot of tea
let's share it
slowly like sisters
<|endoftext|>

the first track still almost swings
high hat and snare even
a few bars of sax the stratosphere will singe-out soon enough
<|endoftext|>

the dark we've only ever imagined now audible thrumming
marbled with static like gristly meat
a chorus of engines churns
<|endoftext|>

silence taunts: a dare
everything that disappears
disappears as if returning somewhere
<|endoftext|>

we'll be passing through heaven in a split pea shell
emptied of light hard as effusive green
ore the blood corrupts daily within and without
<|endoftext|>

carrion flowers
slip
from my hand
<|endoftext|>

is bemidji though the blues here around
more the cast of a kestrel's blue-gray crown
than the blue-black of my cousins back home
<|endoftext|>

stitches the buttons of his shirt to my skin
the snake hisses
the snake is torn
<|endoftext|>

there's always a mother
of some other creature
born to fight for her young
<|endoftext|>

in this glacial quiet
nothing moves except
then a flash of eyes amp nerves
<|endoftext|>

does he exist in the order of things
how does life begin when does it end
and is that good or evil
<|endoftext|>

leading me to inquire
since pathos is out of place
what it is that they are practicing
<|endoftext|>

not with delphi not with fangs or cardamom bought
in fez red with spring red with
marathon running cheeks
<|endoftext|>

by opening anywhere a drop
and its story reappear
as air turns to water water to air
<|endoftext|>

bones are easier to find than flowers
in the desert so i paint these
fine white skulls of cows and horses
<|endoftext|>

i know the dark night of the soul
does not need god's eye
as a beggar does not need a hand or a bowl
<|endoftext|>

there is nothing that controls our thoughts
more than what we think we see
which we label we
<|endoftext|>

while the water still spills and the cat squints at leaves
blown my father wears brahms families lean in on one
for a group shot and the rock remains shattered in a star
<|endoftext|>

how's life
do you cough
do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind
<|endoftext|>

are you bored with her new body
how's it going with an earthly woman
with no sixth sense
<|endoftext|>

he doesn't like the switch-up
what's out there
he wonders in what he'll call ocean for now
<|endoftext|>

to his right is an alligator
but the head-ridge has no bone
it's propped up instead by fumes: rich dark and pungent
<|endoftext|>

far off men are cradling cracked dolphins
arrows of fire shoot out the blowholes
the wounds bleed silver
<|endoftext|>

ii
by the power of the hidden name i-am-that-i-am
and by the dew of desire and blessing the dead will live again
<|endoftext|>

iii
i-am is the power of your name in concealment
and one who knows its mystery dwells in eternity's instant
<|endoftext|>

bring light to my eyes with your teaching and let not the husks
that surround your hosts obstruct me
may heaven and adam's children judge me with mercy
<|endoftext|>

the sky is washed and dark
other eyes have known
and shifted away from my eyes
<|endoftext|>

but i've never heard words like this
in the night
with my head on your chest rest
<|endoftext|>

and who could fail
to search for you
who sends down food when it is due
<|endoftext|>

parched with stubble and the last corn-shocks
unfurlings blood fatigue
deranged by dahlia-nearness
<|endoftext|>

drink tasty antidotes
otherwise
you and the werewolf: newlyweds
<|endoftext|>

how to go on walking hand in hand
without our bodies on the path
we made for our feet talking talking
<|endoftext|>

translate us too rough line by line
into your crystalline
severe design
<|endoftext|>

child who once was come forth
what brings us together now
and what do we have to say
<|endoftext|>

options
teasing enchantment
how still the riddle lies
<|endoftext|>

options
insistent shaft a tighter breathing
the sibyl's many leaves are laurel made for wreathing
<|endoftext|>

a point
get even says the horizon
like the sun democratic and unsparing
<|endoftext|>

joe schiavone was the veteran who took the job not a bad guy
dr
vineburg did get elected mayor joe worked for him for years
<|endoftext|>

all you need's this play of surface
all that you need
all you have
<|endoftext|>

god turned to speak to me
god found i wasn't there
at least not over half
<|endoftext|>

another they give birth
a third they grow new chins
at a fourth they're lopped
<|endoftext|>

i'm inside that brilliant gravity
i think of time i'm in the driver's
nightmare and it shudders by
<|endoftext|>

dove knows the rubric
and starts in who
who is next and soon
<|endoftext|>

you would allow yourself a message
how to make it low-key
how to keep it to a few lines
<|endoftext|>

you lean down into the white heap of black words
you pad out toward the water fountain
into someone's eyeshadowed look the lush backwash of her skirt
<|endoftext|>

often have i wished
i had eight pairs of hands to hold them
and another body for the gun
<|endoftext|>

the skin of the burnished limb
until the skin is just another piece
of your household furniture
<|endoftext|>

it's not too blonde or red
you can grasp
it with your eyes he said the way you wear it
<|endoftext|>

the room the sun never touched
the sound of cars dropping you to sleep
your pupils large amp hungry for light
<|endoftext|>

wheel me down to the shore
where the lighthouse was abandoned
and the moon tolls in the rafters
<|endoftext|>

let me hear the wind paging through the trees
and see the stars flaring out one by one
like the forgotten faces of the dead
<|endoftext|>

we're here for the time being i answer to the query
just for a couple of years we said a dozen years back
nothing is more permanent than the temporary
<|endoftext|>

when we crossed the water we only brought what we could carry
but there are always boxes that you never do unpack
nothing is more permanent than the temporary
<|endoftext|>

and the nearest my father could come to saying what
he made of that was lamely to say he didn't
schumann didn't my father didn't know why
<|endoftext|>

death with honor derides death without
realpolitik and offshore accounts
are erased like a thumb drive lost in a fire
<|endoftext|>

silver liquor of the spirits the winter tuber's pulp
<|endoftext|>

buzz aldrin spied a plain from space: twice rhode island-sized
not a glacier but this vast evaporation a place so flat we use its plane
to calibrate the altitude of satellites measure the retreat of polar ice
<|endoftext|>

where does life begin and end
in the lamb or the cotton
my pillow is my friend
<|endoftext|>

i smell the blood of low-definition attorneys
i smell the blood of low-definition attorneys
i smell the blood of low-definition attorneys
<|endoftext|>

do you find the squeak
of boots on snow
excruciating
<|endoftext|>

returning as ever
to mother's house
under a salty rain
<|endoftext|>

did it ever sit close to the ants and their piles
of dirt from which that body had come
you were a small boy once i suppose
<|endoftext|>

to make the tongue so it could work
who shoved inside that mouth
the shit of a hundred thousand worms
<|endoftext|>

worked hand in hand with him possessor of
the six great gifts of womanhood from needlework
through chastity to sweet words and gentle speech
<|endoftext|>

what names people have
stephen i
yenser
<|endoftext|>

or herbert
george herbert
(such embranglement
<|endoftext|>

or is it the rebellious the disobedient
whose sisters' brothers died on our side near samarra
without whom our world's better off
<|endoftext|>

well my emotional palette is wider now
it includes
colors like i paused
<|endoftext|>

you'd wait in the orchard for hours
to watch a deer
break from the shadows
<|endoftext|>

honors may go to others
riches may go to others
huang gongwang has one great job to do
<|endoftext|>

my ears
why do i only hear such unnatural things
although come to think of it death is completely natural
<|endoftext|>

i'm just exasperated
everywhere life-sounds
swarm this our shared pond like mating turtles
<|endoftext|>

don't buy a book
don't go to bed early
seek out beige in foodstuffs and landscapes
<|endoftext|>

chew gum if you're overwhelmed
you're in this alone
that means there's nobody to stop you
<|endoftext|>

what must go through you when we pass them
at a distance those black maws yawning out of the hillside
exhaling the unspeakable
<|endoftext|>

can't you feel it now
can't you
can't you
<|endoftext|>

between the big buildings
i sat like a flea crouched
in the stopped works of a watch
<|endoftext|>

a lavender fog breeds with our children
our girls are dying on the roadsides
their wombs pried open by the scramble that grows inside
<|endoftext|>

save us from the lavender fog
it's the ghosts of your dead people
who have never bothered our village before
<|endoftext|>

seeing him wave that blood-red bayonet
i reckoned we were glad
to have him on the side
<|endoftext|>

it isn't for anything a poem is country
and it needs you to keep walking it and i walk out into it now carrying my friend
and smelling the paddocky wind and feeling the rain cold on my face
<|endoftext|>

and while we watch magritte's sky turn el greco
roofs de chirico beneath the plastic clouds
a plane is pasted on a sudden patch of blue
<|endoftext|>

pomp lowers his paper for a while to watch
the beauties he's begotten with his ann
these new truths they can hardly wait to teach
<|endoftext|>

outside the window clouds are swelling
into growing darkness and there's a man
hard on his knees planting something in the rain
<|endoftext|>

just enough rain an hour ago
to give the wispy dry grass some hope
turning it green instantly
<|endoftext|>

purples of the mosses turned
some million shades
six million more
<|endoftext|>

maybe a genital-faced bivalve to be dashed
with tabasco and eaten whole or to his glory
produce a pearl
<|endoftext|>

and when it reached the height of enoch
standing he tore whole tongues
down to their colors
<|endoftext|>

without a scar he stood
as the men make their way
into the quaking wood
<|endoftext|>

whatever the cost i pay up at the minnow pools
i don't know anything of the misery of these trapped fish
or the failure of the marsh i'm so hidden
<|endoftext|>

but death is simple
a place to talk shit
to license grief or barring that to kill it
<|endoftext|>

gloved white magician for a sec
he even sees the calla lily's furl
in the gesture of voila
<|endoftext|>

i learned about love
she did not mind at all
the silent steady distance i placed between us
<|endoftext|>

but the queen came to see only me and i saw her
and my life for a while was dismissed
and so repaired
<|endoftext|>

once i lit three twigs and fanned the smoke
from miles away
into the girl who jumbled scales through my spine
<|endoftext|>

c: or it reaches the furthest point
the branch turns from us and is for some arc
fully quiet
<|endoftext|>

something blasted from a boom box in a music store
something in the ineffable clips of light
disappeared over the river
<|endoftext|>

he stood hearing it again
the precise shudder the arrow
sought and returned to flaming
<|endoftext|>

as barbara cohen in high school said about politics
it's interesting giving the word four earnest syllables
in-ter-est-ing
<|endoftext|>

i'm not so much crusted with parasangs or dipped in leagues as fried in miles of a journey resembling the arc between cleo and asp
the jacuzzi on a timer sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree afternoon
there were sight lines to windy breakers heaving palms we floated like epiphytes grown from pond scum flowers of the abyss
<|endoftext|>

it's the nickel in my cheap wedding ring that brings on this rash that starts at the corners of my lips
the ring bought at age twenty-one paid for with the tips from buddy's crabs and ribs
which i now paint religiously with clear nail polish on the inner band across the names the ampersand where the graving bit exposed the nickel
<|endoftext|>

listless as in transcending
desire or not rising
to greet it
<|endoftext|>

you come to tell me
you're saving money
by cooking for yourself
<|endoftext|>

yesterday he said he saw buttercups a type of flower
you go over the tracks first on the other side of the river
and there they are
<|endoftext|>

womb/vagina sets are unusual too if genuine
standards are from china they are recycled sheepskin wallets
i was shocked too when i heard this
<|endoftext|>

they've made new lingo to go with the genuine penis
they say unicorn i say wasabi
apparently almost everyone gets green horseradish with sushi
<|endoftext|>

when i say wasabi near japan it's island
of slow unit dance or remarkable mask
when i say new world it's where the newly suited go
<|endoftext|>

it's not like anything gets taken out
unless it's rotten which it probably isn't
because i feel okay and you look alright
<|endoftext|>

there's not as much empty space as we thought
in the old blueprints that made donuts
in space the halo the homeric lure
<|endoftext|>

the one electron penis and the drone
i've been sick and found all this out because i couldn't
get out of bed and there was a diamond near my head
<|endoftext|>

it's the forward going
i'd like to go boldly
i've kept a card of energy
<|endoftext|>

wilderness saved from childhood
of this secret one must be silent
so the sun can trust us
<|endoftext|>

kids need each other
better they never get
separated entirely
<|endoftext|>

well i myself am not myself
and which power of survival i speak
for is not made of houses
<|endoftext|>

it is inner luxury of golden figures
that breathe like mountains do
and whose skin is made dusky by stars
<|endoftext|>

i have no sense of what this means to you so little
sense of what to make of it myself save one lit glimpse
of how we live and move a more expansive sense in whom
<|endoftext|>

got a prayer
if i had two hands
to rub together i wouldn't waste the air
<|endoftext|>

find me when
you want
i'll wait
<|endoftext|>

and as quietly as the sound of kleenex
being pulled from a box
i sneezed
<|endoftext|>

and a rose opened her portals
and the scent ran up an elephant's trunk
or tried to
<|endoftext|>

what rises in such a clearing
what stays home
checking and re-checking the egg
<|endoftext|>

easy to fix the lens
but nearly impossible to reach it
as far out from us as it has drifted already
<|endoftext|>

she came into my view as vivid as
somebody on a screen in a movie seen
elegant in the focus of my eye
<|endoftext|>

other people were there wearing pajamas
streaming out of some hideyhole or other
into the way that that was how i saw them
<|endoftext|>

i mean of the dancer to the audience
flirtatious and familiar only for you
and entirely impersonal and withheld
<|endoftext|>

untouchable and untouched and moving to
the sounds of something else from somewhere else
the music maybe of his madness was it
<|endoftext|>

it was as if he skated in solitude
and glided whirling on a lonely tarn
far out away from everything there is
<|endoftext|>

to make our list
we bring more and more
money to the table but the list outruns it
<|endoftext|>

coinage of the not-yet-wholly
hardened custodians of public
health as health is roughly measured
<|endoftext|>

wrote about our parents in the garden
and mindfulness
but first
<|endoftext|>

when a body is ripe it falls and rots from the softest spot
only when a child slips and drops off a tree
the tree suddenly learns that it is barren
<|endoftext|>

for that is what we are made for for that
we are created
until the dark hours are done
<|endoftext|>

and we rise again in the dawn
infinite particles of the divine sun now
worshipped in the pitches of the night
<|endoftext|>

the blind man was traveling home with his fate
now thankful for blindness
happy about it
<|endoftext|>

there were two kingdoms only
the first of them threw out both him and me
the second we abandoned
<|endoftext|>

under a bare sky
i for a long time soaked in the rain of my body
he for a long time rotted in the rain of his
<|endoftext|>

every day i go to earn my bread
in the exchange where lies are marketed
hoping my own lies will attract a bid
<|endoftext|>

my birth without me
was a blemished offering on the collection plate
a moment of flesh imprisoned in flesh
<|endoftext|>

gunshot
if it strikes me in hanoi
it strikes again in prague
<|endoftext|>

a little smoke floats up
and my me dies like an eighth-month child
will my me one day be my contemporary
<|endoftext|>

where the immemorial and the instant meet opening and distance appear
through the opening: a door crack of light
behind the door a kitchen
<|endoftext|>

where the knife rises and falls clouds gather disperse
a lightspeed joining of life and death cut
in two: halves of a sun of slowness
<|endoftext|>

little soul
you have wandered
lost a long time
<|endoftext|>

the fairy tales warn you
do not go in
you who would eat will be eaten
<|endoftext|>

you want to have feet
you want to have eyes
you want to have fears

then slip through petals through petal after petal

like any penelope my armor is resignation
although i thought i would lift the bow myself
and draw
<|endoftext|>

and like the sea
one more machine without a memory
i don't believe that you made me
<|endoftext|>

incrementally i stand
in me are eons and the cramp

broken heel covered in wet newspaper and
huddled up next to the highway
all thumbs
<|endoftext|>

i saw the shrouds of prisoners
like baptismal gowns
buried outside the cemetery

awful residue
from a small cut
<|endoftext|>

the cuff is frightening
stuffed onto oil
water-stains might fence its ghost in

the article of clothing

terrible emptiness of the spread

half-cooked squares

of paint pool-sized
blue and ridged like foam

hooded stranger with papa's voice the makeshift bed
<|endoftext|>

in meiner heimat
where the dead walked
and the living were made of cardboard
<|endoftext|>

and you wept
and flowers bowed their heads
and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled
<|endoftext|>

i won't be dying after all not now but will go on living dizzily
hereafter in reality half-deaf to reality in the room
perfumed by the fire that our inextinguishable will begins
<|endoftext|>

for those who accused their ancestors
of eating salt there were these hands
tracing what was left after the sweat
<|endoftext|>

i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery
<|endoftext|>

light was on its way
from nothing
to nowhere
<|endoftext|>

light was all business
light was full speed
when it got interrupted
<|endoftext|>

i find it in a field of feathers pink-crested
a knuckle of bone picked clean by the wind
a pale mohawk mounted on stone
<|endoftext|>

a still point byzantine one star
in a galaxy of trillions
i had to find my friends
<|endoftext|>

if i hadn't jostled the mosaic
maybe i could stop the picture
buildings of stirred beach glass
<|endoftext|>

stars
are the campfires
of exiles
<|endoftext|>

language exists
to pull things
close
<|endoftext|>

first the factory stood quiet as an asylum
then the annihilating mallee with its red fists of blossoms
and the mountain ash creeping over it like a stain
<|endoftext|>

i have no proof but i tell you
there were leadlight windows here once barred
they cast a little striped light on the women
<|endoftext|>

londonderry cork galway kildare
as i say the words they are sucked away
to a hemisphere in darkness
<|endoftext|>

and it was lucky or as lucky as it would get
there was time and light the hawks and dogs
had not been written yet and were still out of sight
<|endoftext|>

am
one-quarter past
distant chimes inform me this
<|endoftext|>

daybreak lies chained to a blue wall
from which the stars drop
and lose all meaning
<|endoftext|>

crescent moons hover above her
ancient white feathers birdless wingless
lost to their own meaning
<|endoftext|>

darling was his final word
for her
softly in arabic
<|endoftext|>

here is the painted world in an actual image
[i have no
theory for the clouds he sees
<|endoftext|>

over forty years ago
a tense cunningly moving tale by the hunga
then he moved on and i went close behind
<|endoftext|>

without legs
she does as much sitting
as anyone who ever sat on a throne
<|endoftext|>

the sun came miss brooks
and we goofed the whole thing
i think
<|endoftext|>

there's a flutter of grey through the trees
ah the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes
fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is
<|endoftext|>

it was only a flutter of grey
but the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances
has set my heart beating the way of old dances
<|endoftext|>

little soul
it is strange
even now it is early
<|endoftext|>

thou seemest to my fancy singing here
and gathering flowers as that fair maiden when
she lost the spring and ceres her more dear
<|endoftext|>

the clouds part the rain ceases the sun
casts now upon everyone
its ancient shadow
<|endoftext|>

what i got was the smell of goneness the smell of screen
doors where moths have spent their wing powder
beating failingly to reach the light
<|endoftext|>

i will stand in the open doorway
under the weight of watching trees and moon
and care for it as one of my own
<|endoftext|>

i will inhale with words every ear
pressed upon open air
i will not be meek
<|endoftext|>

you remind me of the necessity
of having more hope than fear
and of sounding out terrible names
<|endoftext|>

i am to cry out loud
like a hungry lamb cry loud
enough to waken wolves in the night
<|endoftext|>

ancient branches crack and splinter into dust
large wings snap open in spring
like carpets splayed out over the railing
<|endoftext|>

daily in the density there is life
on the edge of the knife that cuts the world
into hemispheres of sense and death
<|endoftext|>

tree the breeze combs
white into a final note
her diminuendo poco a poco
<|endoftext|>

moon-afro myself
outpaces me
in wonder of her
<|endoftext|>

the cracked shell of his translucent skin
buried in rubble now and those teeth
all that remain of terrible and invisible jaws
<|endoftext|>

a giant squid finally let itself be captured
in a photograph and the paper nautilus ripple-flashes
scarlet and two kinds of violet when it silvers you near
<|endoftext|>

they so liked breast milk
joanne fell asleep amp leaked
the ants woke up made the sweet climb
<|endoftext|>

make a pretty cayenne path for
over the once-food-strewn
sill
<|endoftext|>

the number of communal legs alone
exceeds the stars
underground
<|endoftext|>

a snail sank  grand in puss and rime on three coils (equals
one tea-wheel) white
the wheel brings the bill the bill  bald
<|endoftext|>

when they could take no more
when all that you had was given
you lined your grave with paper
<|endoftext|>

owl astronaut burgeoning owl is a gift
you give to me give to you
terrible other things happen
<|endoftext|>

when my blood seemed uncontrollable ran messy with pulp
down their fingers my cousins finally left the room laughing
closing the basement door behind them
<|endoftext|>

when ecstasy approaches why do you resist
what are you afraid of
can you please unbutton your shirt now
<|endoftext|>

then the sun wiped its forehead
with long filmy fingers
and beamed afresh
<|endoftext|>

although they are shaped like a parachute
thanks to the air pressure beneath them
raindrops  explode on landing
<|endoftext|>

sometimes it falls on bare rocks
at others  it raises
large forests of leafing trees
<|endoftext|>

back the beam was there something broken
i weather compliant
i rally
<|endoftext|>

i'll read entrails
for omens action
figure entrails
<|endoftext|>

the gold iron floor lamps
the off-brand running shoes
fila but not really
<|endoftext|>

there has never been any life
beyond this circle of firelight
until now if now is no dream but an asia
<|endoftext|>

stiffened with silence broke
the private change the public good
to dive into pits of leaves
<|endoftext|>

my only child
how
i've betrayed you
<|endoftext|>

gold nearly blinding herdsmen and kings
and with its broad warm tongue
a cow licking the afterbirth from the hay
<|endoftext|>

my fish fast and loose shoot fish in a kettle
the boys like the girls who like heavy metal
on sabbath on slayer on maiden and venom
<|endoftext|>

she asked about my heart
its evasive flight
but can i trust her with its secrets
<|endoftext|>

blinded by light or black cloth
so many ways
not to see others suffer
<|endoftext|>

four birds outside this afternoon
four distinct calls
in a dispirited late daylight
<|endoftext|>

oh and the bored laughter behind the camera
and the impossibility the inconsequence
of any sympathy
<|endoftext|>

large moon the deep orange of embers
also the scent
the griefs of others beautiful at a distance
<|endoftext|>

in my hands i hold a broom
in my heart
ashes ashes
<|endoftext|>

make me a figure
blue little throats
scintillas of the anatomical
<|endoftext|>

sometimes the smallest things weigh us down
small stones that we can't help
admiring and palming
<|endoftext|>

look at the tiny way
this lighter vein got inside
look at the heavy gray dome of its sky
<|endoftext|>

boulder grain
planet dust
what fills the stones fills us
<|endoftext|>

i remember or i have a feeling
i could be living somewhere with you
weighted down the way we aren't now
<|endoftext|>

often the greatest things
those you'd think would be the heaviest
are the very ones that float
<|endoftext|>

so i etched harmless in that ground of merds and moss
and to this day my people listen to strangers crying wares
with an intelligent ear remembering our grave old danger
<|endoftext|>

to cry out more room
crack
like a shell heave between its crushing shores
<|endoftext|>

that's how it is that's it throwing your jacket over your shoulders
like a towel and saying goodbye victoria goodbye sophie goodbye
lili goodbye sweetie take care be well hang in there see you soon
<|endoftext|>

but soon to solo unfold all
those origami limbs to test
the inevitable debutante bawl
<|endoftext|>

who could have fashioned the test that would have
predicted this success
who could have known
<|endoftext|>

of our winter as though today
only she can see where she
goes and track where she's been
<|endoftext|>

the hale
yellows pale once
they're plucked
<|endoftext|>

or what i refer to as where
you look upon the place you
cannot return one broke on through
<|endoftext|>

and by the time i have taken in the third
the second is likewise gone a blown-out candle now
a wavering line of acrid smoke
<|endoftext|>

number one across
a four-letter word
for no longer
<|endoftext|>

number one down
an eleven letter word
for gone
<|endoftext|>

where one of the kids was handing out something that turned out
to be small pieces of orange peel something exotic we'd never
seen before which i smelled nibbled and finally ate for this poem
<|endoftext|>

and that time rolls around for all of us
getting frustrated and mad because they meant
but did not know they meant themselves too
<|endoftext|>

just like you i entered this world
mad and kicking and without you
it's precisely how i intend to go
<|endoftext|>

we poked him through the clover
into a hole and then
we threw brown earth right over
<|endoftext|>

through a pane of glass
that shivers when the wind kicks up
i watch my son walk away
<|endoftext|>

though lowly its stem
this emerald gem
mates with the proudest that shadow the earth
<|endoftext|>

beneath the trees' arsenical
sharp woodwind tunes heretical
blown like the wind's mane
<|endoftext|>

and with his bound heart and his young eyes bent
and blind he feels her presence like shed scent
holding him body and life within its snare
<|endoftext|>

my eyes are caked with dust of oat-fields at harvest-time
i am a blind man who stares across the hills seeking stack'd fields
of other harvesters
<|endoftext|>

my ears are caked with dust of oat-fields at harvest-time
i am a deaf man who strains to hear the calls of other harvesters whose
throats are also dry
<|endoftext|>

with an outward stroke of power intense your mighty arm goes forth
cleaving its way through waters that rise and roll ever a ceaseless vigil keeping
over the treasures beneath
<|endoftext|>

my heart goes out to you of dauntless courage and spirit indomitable
and though my lips would speak my spirit forbids me to ask
is your heart as true as your arm
<|endoftext|>

slicing this frozen sky know
where they are going
and want to get there
<|endoftext|>

their women and homes forgotten
you can't
hear their screams from here but they're there
<|endoftext|>

i forget
regardless i know that someone said
in a perfect universe we'd all be dead
<|endoftext|>

but the lightning was as quick as it was loud
the clouds dispersed
and then so did the crowd
<|endoftext|>

shrubbery thrashing to get in
lines all panes
long windows split in parallels
<|endoftext|>

i make a knife of words
i sit here waiting
i play with crumbs
<|endoftext|>

i
open ward at the elisabeth hospital berlin
my tongue is a spoon
<|endoftext|>

once there was no language
for the weather just   the sky is low and birdless
or the sky is a box of wings
<|endoftext|>

stubborn calendar of bone
last snow
now it must always be so
<|endoftext|>

she's a mathematical wonder with so many calculations
kept alive in her head adding and subtracting
when everyone else is asleep
<|endoftext|>

when we know we'll get some
thing from what
he takes away
<|endoftext|>

late days
i want to drive to your grave
but i don't belong to it
<|endoftext|>

northern follows jig
body flashes with strike dive
broken line floats up
<|endoftext|>

i can't articulate
the agony of eagle singer's
children to them
<|endoftext|>

walk naked before me
carrying a sheaf of sticks
it's the most honest thing a man can do
<|endoftext|>

cynomyopsis cadavarena
on every tongue
they feed
<|endoftext|>

i'm not in with this mystery
somebody steady me
cool ocean breezes don't make me laugh
<|endoftext|>

i'm in with noisy metal little nils
a million apologies
i must have made more
<|endoftext|>

this is cruising
at watch-me
miles-an-hour
<|endoftext|>

a crow gliding over a ravine was
the sign his eyes were waiting for
they thought they were ready to cross
<|endoftext|>

for years i have been here without a clear map
that hopes should dim as days go on above is
natural i suppose what do i know
<|endoftext|>

i am dressed like one of them
the thick walls quake but stay soundproof
i fear my fists vestigial
<|endoftext|>

all shapes breaking hysterical particles and subs who settled
devoting former whir of shape to silence
which was enough
<|endoftext|>

it stayed uniform silent for some many months
which strengthened to pull outer space noise in to neutralize
but lost its grip
<|endoftext|>

so this sound hard-pressed in to sink holes
and look into original force that was still shut in
under black lacquer cabinetry: our future perfect world
<|endoftext|>

it opened the door of dust
the space sound picked up pings distantly
seeing to sound is what and how bounceback
<|endoftext|>

since the dust so still and small
the waves skinnied high-pitched
to switch on resistance of an average mote
<|endoftext|>

what would stand to receive
what was the point of pointing out resisting decay
what was there to say
<|endoftext|>

so sound deranged to be
needle pierce to dust piece
and sunned a word heard first by the bygone
<|endoftext|>

and the silence startled by the sneaking sound
forgot its own high ground
and grumbled some rebuke
<|endoftext|>

we wondered what our walk should mean
taking that un-march quietly
the sun stared at our signs thou shalt not kill
<|endoftext|>

men by a tavern said those foreigners
to a woman with a fur who turned away
like an elevator going down their look at us
<|endoftext|>

along a curb their signs lined across
a picket line stopped and stared
the whole width of the street at ours: unfair
<|endoftext|>

insomniac monkey-mind ponders the dove
symbol not only of peace but sexual
love the couple nestled and brooding
<|endoftext|>

monkey-mind envies the male dove
who equally with the female secretes
pigeon milk for the young from his throat
<|endoftext|>

for peace send all human males between
fourteen and twenty-five to school
on the moon or better yet mars
<|endoftext|>

is peace merely a vacuum the negative
of creation or the absence of war
the teaching says peace is a positive energy
<|endoftext|>

still something in me resists that sweet milk
my mind resembles my restless inferior cousin
who fires his shit in handfuls from his cage
<|endoftext|>

that takes and takes and never fills
i kick
stroke my tired arms to buoy this body
<|endoftext|>

not ever
want picks the human heart
you're the lie i won't believe forever
<|endoftext|>

i broke my left wing in the revolution
when troops were sent to vandalize the chapel
they hit me once almost apologetically
<|endoftext|>

of boys who knew no better
way to grow up than throw up
the crown amp be down for whatever
<|endoftext|>

silent resonances of glass configured
had i but struck us off the masque of blackness
as it was playing
<|endoftext|>

like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap
let this be the sign
i'm getting a grip on the sacrifice
<|endoftext|>

here we are left with
the stairway that separates my
i am not at the mercy of men  oceans
<|endoftext|>

between one airplane and
their innocence wanes under
the word has sunk   silence to us is forbidden
<|endoftext|>

one or another nightmare may come true
and what to do then
what in the world to do
<|endoftext|>

and so now i'm sitting in a dimly lit
where the windows are covered with soot
and the coffee is warm and bitter
<|endoftext|>

so full
of longing for the world
changes its shape
<|endoftext|>

a vigilant gun that always picks out
the right target even if it's you
no matter who you're aiming at
<|endoftext|>

a truck so awesome only the president
of the united states of america's allowed
to careen in it to his own beat
<|endoftext|>

all the greatest hits from the last millennium
performed live on stage on the inside
of your state of the art acoustically-enhanced skull
<|endoftext|>

a complete set of nude photos
of you taken by you and sold
back to you at a discount
<|endoftext|>

rain water in a bottle sunshine in a box
and ambience sounds from a bus stop
down the street recorded on a cd
<|endoftext|>

a baseball game that never ends
to be played simultaneously with
a football game that never ends
<|endoftext|>

landmines made with dough
topped with mozzarella and all
your favorite toppings
<|endoftext|>

and i did
i liked it so much that now we're
getting married
<|endoftext|>

i love you for your holes she said
not just the holes in your shoes and socks but the
gaping holes in your personality
<|endoftext|>

i have never been fishing on the susquehanna
or on any river for that matter
to be perfectly honest
<|endoftext|>

not in july or any month
have i had the pleasure if it is a pleasure
of fishing on the susquehanna
<|endoftext|>

sitting in a small green
flat-bottom boat
holding the thin whip of a pole
<|endoftext|>

that is something i am unlikely
ever to do i remember
saying to myself and the person next to me
<|endoftext|>

a philosopher did not realize that the man who expelled poetry from
well-ordered republics used to tremble at the thought of doing so
thereby creating through that very act a sublime poetry
<|endoftext|>

an entire landscape in antarctica disappears evaporates until salt becomes the only debris
there are keys to everything even handcuffs
you could have been happy too
<|endoftext|>

but i covered my face and wept
for ashes are not beautiful
even in the dawn
<|endoftext|>

but still i walked on
in the drowning rain
slowly winding up the string
<|endoftext|>

i seek him for atonement of my sin
this day of fasting to forgive the wrong
and he will answer he will say forgiven
<|endoftext|>

when the loons cry
the night seems blacker
the water deeper
<|endoftext|>

across the shore
an eyelash-charcoal
fringe of pine trees
<|endoftext|>

they pack their bags and take the train
and travel through a strange terrain
but not to where the castle is
<|endoftext|>

we wakeful ah pity us
we that go back with policeman day
back from the city of sleep
<|endoftext|>

of your body) pleasured corners of a place
in which the difficult new breathing
and i are foreigners
<|endoftext|>

let it be to gain all it can in one fetter
but if it be life
let it attempt a failed recognition
<|endoftext|>

let its thinker be the failure
my thinker is failure
and i want to teach it how to move in this world
<|endoftext|>

tonight i stitch
the breeze off the bay smells of aria
it is almost the season for cloaks
<|endoftext|>

which is to say the only private one sole unrevealed
opaque
center of his universal panopticon
<|endoftext|>

ready to receive remains built for death ready to receive the flatly desolate superficial deeply commissioned intellectual offer of suggestive actions for the hunger assassin to fall back on and become forcefull psychological damage bottled for drinkable agitation
riding a back seat writing construction contesting the oncoming molten universe immersed in villagers city dwellers trembling laughing  to inhale flesh and stone from long ago forgetting the horrors of holy oil infusion clocks and gritty body galleries leaving behind the mourning river's crimson fragrance smoldering from the previous unbearable fever
in a posture of myself on a speeding body without hands and feet i am ready to receive the vomit of consciousness and proceed down the avenues of suggestion to become a limited option
<|endoftext|>

an owl out on the marsh
by november
it will be nailed through the breast to the barn

then the page on which nothing happens
the page after this page

absorbed now in the dream of skin on skin

and destined promises she'd never share

neither of us wants to go but both just said
sure i'll go

the sun came out
it was the old sun
with only a few billion years left to shine
<|endoftext|>

the last line should strike like a lover's complaint
you should never see it coming
and you should never hear the end of it

i am not thinking about you
it is a new way of thinking about you

there's no proof i can

fish detaching from its canvas of silk
or rice paper a
swirl of color motion swimming away
<|endoftext|>

i want the image even when i am it or nearly it
because even then i am also that other thing
self-conscious burdened struggling for movement
<|endoftext|>

what do we do when we hate our bodies
a good coat helps
some know how to pull off a hat
<|endoftext|>

we say is another mirror
a depth a conjure in which we might meet
someone who says touch me
<|endoftext|>

maybe it's unfair
a possum entering
the argument here
<|endoftext|>

by our brutal beautiful
and very pleased
little dog
<|endoftext|>

thinking how different
in our adversaries
we are from possums
<|endoftext|>

into a sky full of congratulations

we tore out onto jermyn street along which i performed

to call our own
but we're gonna make it

undercurrent of an unwillingness to believe all
is well in early spring beside a molten river riven by sun
its loud hush and glug through leafless aspens split by a gravel bar's pulled switch

the soil must have tasted
you once
it is laden with your scent
<|endoftext|>

the trees honor you
in gold
and blush when you pass

i know why the desert
burns with fever
it was wept too long without you

on hands and knees
the ocean begs up the beach
and falls at your feet
<|endoftext|>

i break a sweat the dish is still cold
read my palm do what it says
it's time that we get up on all fours
<|endoftext|>

and for years i believed
that what went unsaid between us became empty
and pure like starlight  amp that it persisted
<|endoftext|>

i got it all wrong
i wound up believing in words the way a scientist
believes in carbon after death
<|endoftext|>

in his tremor he curses
the landlord who grins
from inside the rent book

where we are harnessed
by alien electric shadows

we brought hannah home today
in afternoon sun with a crisp chill in the air
on a hill overlooking the bay

tonight i have a date to share a steamy bath
with linda hogan and joy harjo
and it's gonna be gooooood
<|endoftext|>

often i'd rise from my lullaby sleep and stare into the darkness of the road
the long darkness empty of cars
glowy from daddy's headlights and lonesome from hank williams' deep and twangy voice singing of cold nights and cheatin' hearts

you are the love song
played on a reedless flute

i burned with love in
empty rooms i sternly turned
knives within myself
<|endoftext|>

but nothing could kill
a faith like a guillotine
as heavy as light
<|endoftext|>

into the heavens
flew a breathless legion of
impossible crows

i am angry with my eyes for not seeing you
they smart and ache and see the snow
an insistent brilliance

it reminds me of the night when my mother and i slept in our ltd while the cops surrounded our apartment complex
i remember someone standing near the yellow tape saying a had robbed the market across the street that the manager was shot twice
once in the arm once in the shoulder and that the gunmen were held up in their apartment squealing threats from their window
<|endoftext|>

now when i look at her that same girl with a busted eye and lip i wonder: if when
she stabbed was she stabbing the boyfriend who beat her for burning supper or was
it her dad for wrenching his arm around her neck prodding a pistol at her head on that balmy night of echo and threat
<|endoftext|>

and it would purr though of course

not it in yours

her head and her hands do a jive in the air you can feel it
as the bus rolls on stopping at each red light in a long wheeze
jerking and idling rumbling up and lurching off again

you are like me but my abyss is clear

won't open to me it's shackled
inside its cage: love and rage
whose bars are meant to be broken

no one here remembers
the love of a chair for its ottoman
or the privacy of a shut door

windows grieve in their sashes
they burn with interior light
like blood oranges

to love each other
we stared through grief

there is so much sweetness in children's voices
and so much discontent at the end of day
and so much satisfaction when a train goes by

i don't know why the rooster keeps crying
nor why elephants keep raising their trunks
nor why hawthorne kept hearing trains at night

a handsome child is a gift from god
and a friend is a vein in the back of the hand
and a wound is an inheritance from the wind

some say we are living at the end of time
but i believe a thousand pagan ministers
will arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind

they climb the staircase clenching branches of pens filled with ducks' blood

goose feathers thorning out of their eyes

just coins clanking in the tin box

heavily plunged from the roof the snow
she answered my mother 'tis well i go
sparkled the north star the wrack flew high
<|endoftext|>

first at his head and last at his feet
kneeling i watched till his soul did fleet
none else that loved him none else were nigh
<|endoftext|>

i sought her afar through the spectral trees
the fells were all muffled the floods did freeze
and a wrathful moon hung red in the sky
<|endoftext|>

by night i found her where pent waves steal
but she lay stiff by the locked mill-wheel
and the old stars lived in their homes on high

this is the time
of the tragic man
that lies in the house of bedlam
<|endoftext|>

erecting beyond the boundaries of all government his grand station and customs i find what i have made there a gate a staking out of his art in inconsequence
i have in mind a poetry that will frame the willingness of the heart and deliver it over to the arrest of time a sentence as if there could stand some solidity most spacial in its intent against the drifts and appearances that arise and fall away in time from the crude events of physical space
the mind alone holds the consequence of the erection to be true so that desire and imagination usurp the place of the invisible throne

she is trying to say something but her mouth
has been painted deliberately shut
her lips thin

ink runs from the corners of my mouth
there is no happiness like mine
i have been eating poetry
<|endoftext|>

the librarian does not believe what she sees
her eyes are sad
and she walks with her hands in her dress
<|endoftext|>

the poems are gone
the light is dim
the dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up
<|endoftext|>

their eyeballs roll
their blond legs burn like brush
the poor librarian begins to stamp her feet and weep
<|endoftext|>

she does not understand
when i get on my knees and lick her hand
she screams
<|endoftext|>

i am a new man
i snarl at her and bark
i romp with joy in the bookish dark
<|endoftext|>

suicide
a quitter
oh no
<|endoftext|>

in the daytime i walk around with the ten
commandments on my lips
like an old tune someone hums to himself
<|endoftext|>

i remember my father waking me for early prayers
he would do it by gently stroking my forehead not
by tearing away the blanket

you hear them while you wait and when the bus pulls up
finally and you get on

she dances only in her necklace

a good way to fall in love
is to turn off the headlights
and drive very fast down dark roads
<|endoftext|>

another way to fall in love
is to say they are only mints
and swallow them with a strong drink
<|endoftext|>

then it is autumn in the body
your hands are cold
then it is winter and we are still at war
<|endoftext|>

not a car in sight
a cemetery seen from the air
all the obelisks you could ever ask for
<|endoftext|>

frosty green through gray rising steeply
top of the bank a big top red with a sign
misty fantastical on the walk to school
<|endoftext|>

you do less of
the sun
is too bright
<|endoftext|>

yet all do still aver
the little babe lies buried there
beneath that hill of moss so fair
<|endoftext|>

is love what we are
or has happiness come to me in a private car
that's so very small i'm amazed to see it there
<|endoftext|>

the magic of numbers
how strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment upstairs
i was twenty-six and you were twenty-two

their voicing ceased then started again to complain
that we are offered nothing when it starts to rain
in the same way though we are dying for the truth
<|endoftext|>

i couldn't tell anyone about this sight
each defeat
is sweet
<|endoftext|>

they'll dart underground when you try to catch them
plunge into quicksand whirlpools mazes
turn into scorpions when you try to catch them
<|endoftext|>

we all just
trying to leave
a mark
<|endoftext|>

i will be waiting
to be with you
then
<|endoftext|>

in my waking hour i see
the remnant of the war between
my head and heart
<|endoftext|>

your footsteps in and out of the bedroom
your lips touching my cheek lightly
and the sound of the door shutting
<|endoftext|>

in your light
i fall asleep again under the warm quilt
happily like a child
<|endoftext|>

the mountains hid santa anas
the smog went orange with dusk the growing shadows
of lingering birds
<|endoftext|>

a living museum
exist to be observed
never migrate but live then die under the dome
<|endoftext|>

lips lashes eyes
from outside in
do beings magnify under the dome
<|endoftext|>

then with no warning
flukes of three orcas
rise arc clear of sea water
<|endoftext|>

you are the man who walked out
as he walked in the bomb went off
and you lived to tell
<|endoftext|>

look out
fore
i hate you
<|endoftext|>

they are called the dead who lived through their deaths
and among my people
they are considered wise and honest
<|endoftext|>

they float out of their bodies
and light on the ceiling like a moth
watching the efforts of everyone around them
<|endoftext|>

i used toxins and poisons
to make you immaculate
i wanted you perfect
<|endoftext|>

i nailed a no-trespassing sign
and a big security light to your side
i sold pieces of you off
<|endoftext|>

season after season you return
sap rising up from your roots
unfinished always becoming
<|endoftext|>

i defended against love
for as long as i could
until i couldn't
<|endoftext|>

roll on roll on roll on
tonight i'm wearing a red dress
under a man's honeyed mouths and tent
<|endoftext|>

through sacred ceremony of living daily living
arose three distinct hopes three loves
out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday
<|endoftext|>

no
so is it what she is said to have said that night
when she breathed a secret and put the whole room on stall
<|endoftext|>

the private eye the girl with a shadowy past the old-style cop
and it's nigh-on certain she'll have to take a bullet
or we'll see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop
<|endoftext|>

his smell still on her reek of the barley mow
and hers on him which could have been sloe
or sweat and sandalwood but you'd be the one to know
<|endoftext|>

how kind time is altering space
so nothing stays wrong and light
more new light always arrives
<|endoftext|>

nothing remained: nothing the wanton name
that nightly i rehearsed till led away
to a dark sleep or sleep that held one dream
<|endoftext|>

in this a huge contagious absence lay
more space than space over the cloud and slime
defined but by the encroachments of its sway
<|endoftext|>

stripped to indifference at the turns of time
whose end i knew i woke without desire
and welcomed zero as a paradigm
<|endoftext|>

and there there i am
alone in that night
hearing that door slam
<|endoftext|>

and the word she mouths to herself as she looks up from her book for
that word as she repeats it
repeats it
<|endoftext|>

nightmare of beasthood snorting how to wake
i woke
what beasthood skin she made me take
<|endoftext|>

into what bulk has method disappeared
like ham streaked
i am gross grey gross flap-eared
<|endoftext|>

oh a man's flesh already is in mine
hand and foot poised for risk
buried in swine
<|endoftext|>

notes we pinned to the trees told him
we moved to another
island that forms the sound
<|endoftext|>

we live in the sound
he found
our voices pinned to the trees
<|endoftext|>

then the return to words
thought has taken a contract out on
in order to move them around
<|endoftext|>

blind man anvil
no hammer strikes
your eyes are spikes
<|endoftext|>

that's not humility you see on our long final journeys
it's procrastination
it hurts my heavy body to lie down
<|endoftext|>

so let me cease my scribbling for to-day
and maiden turn thy lovely face this way
words will not do but haply kisses may
<|endoftext|>

the cliff above where we stand is crumbling
and up on the palisades
the sidewalks buckle like a broken conveyer belt
<|endoftext|>

we walk back to the car
and take the top down for the ride home
through the early mist
<|endoftext|>

where you live beyond the facts
of what your body has given you
as the first taste of death
<|endoftext|>

consequences emerge when a man and desire
are part of the words we hurl you
changing how you mean loving this terrible final news
<|endoftext|>

it was the hornbill that spoke it
in the nothing becoming nothing
begetting nothing this is everything
<|endoftext|>

the evening empty as a convex
coconut split down the seam
not that it can be filled
<|endoftext|>

the evening empty as a gourd
that twists on an iron thread
the rough skin of the sphere
<|endoftext|>

the stars are suddenly remote
candescent petals night throws
above the yard the beautiful things
<|endoftext|>

red
red
red
<|endoftext|>

paula's paintings are real
the women thick visceral
like stubborn cliffs the sea cannot contain or drown
<|endoftext|>

necromancer necromancer necromancer
make me a mate
only one of my ribs pray take

is that why in the photograph david plays

don't try to understand what another
person means by love
don't even bother
<|endoftext|>

the critics will babble and frenzy
forever to find the nouns she never wrote
between the crowded verbs and adverbs

he called her: the heart and the womb

rose petals he picks up in the neighbor's yard

you need that craft the precision of measurement
angles of angels
who incidentally are never women
<|endoftext|>

i have to thank god i'm a woman
for in these ordered days a woman only
is free to be very hungry very lonely
<|endoftext|>

and makes a curse
and makes a sugar of
the malocclusions the inconditions of love
<|endoftext|>

when i put my finger to the hole they've cut for a dimmer switch
in a wall of plaster stiffened with horsehair
it seems i've scratched a two-hundred-year-old itch
<|endoftext|>

of a chain of forms infinite
summed to a singular value
the elegy as a place to begin
<|endoftext|>

it is a human love i live inside
a bony skeleton
you recognize as words or simple feeling
<|endoftext|>

but it has no feeling
as the metal is hot it is not
given to love
<|endoftext|>

the tour bus stops on the road's edge
on the right a black town the left indian
pointing he says: this is the racial divide
<|endoftext|>

yet love hums like turning forks
and the fading spreading sound
is the growth of something more
<|endoftext|>

the woman singing in zulu in a jamaican bar
is calling down fire calling down fire
there is no contradiction

when orators advertise the american eagle's
virtues the american eagle is not listening
this is his virtue
<|endoftext|>

he is somewhere else he is mountains away
but even if he were near he would never
make an audience
<|endoftext|>

if we have honored him we have honored one
who unequivocally honors himself by
overlooking us
<|endoftext|>

he does not know the meaning of magnificent
perhaps we do not altogether either
who cannot touch him
<|endoftext|>

and we are like the blind musician
at the hotel who tells us with a smile
i'll see you later

the leaf you pick from the fall

fingers stiff from time you trace

there are two kinds of people soldiers and women
as virginia woolf said
both for decoration only
<|endoftext|>

you are my stranger and see how we have closed
on both ends
night wets me all night blind carried
<|endoftext|>

but you really love this woman how come no one can see this
everyone must
become suddenly very clumsy at recognizing beauty if you are to keep her
<|endoftext|>

you don't want to lose anything at all ever
you want her sex depilated you
want everyone else not blind but perhaps paralyzed from the eyes down
<|endoftext|>

the other replied
torn loose from the eaves
the blood trembles at the lips

till the villain left the paths of ease
to walk in perilous paths and drive
the just man into barren climes

as for the fourth taxi he was alone

my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee
i was sired and weaned in a tropic world
the palm tree and banana leaf mango and coconut breadfruit and rubber trees know me
<|endoftext|>

i want the cotton fields tabacco and the cane
i want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground
restless music is in my heart and i am eager to be gone

he cries that the magnets get stronger
when he peels the pods to find no difference
in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love
<|endoftext|>

in the alembic forged her shafts and hurled
at pain diseases waging a humane war
greater than this achievement none i ween
<|endoftext|>

apparently

he told her about things she could see
how the dismal cover of clouds roils and explodes
and the ground aches like an old woman's knee
<|endoftext|>

how wood rots against the tide
good for hunting grub
how to fade and fall back into the wind
<|endoftext|>

that last night they drank from the river
sucked its delicate cusps of mold
sang anti social songs as if they were humans
<|endoftext|>

when he flicked his handsome head
to catch the drift of wind
she even managed a single tear
<|endoftext|>

the metallic conductor captured her eyes
she remembered how he proudly sang her name
as he pranced from pole-top to kv line
<|endoftext|>

hence the delightsome gardens the dark shores
the terrifying forests where nightfall
enfolds a lost and tired traveler
<|endoftext|>

and what shall we make of it love perhaps
what elevator is this anyway that even the prospect
of going down has made you high
<|endoftext|>

is the color of emergency as i do
need saving from solid things
most of all their dissolve
<|endoftext|>

that was the old landscape
all the new poems

see you tonight by the sovereign chartreuse
ceramics at the met
let's hear what you'd do differently

for an hour i stood on two legs
and ran
for an hour i panted and galloped

tomorrow mainly sunny
high sunshine and just a few clouds will fill the sky
breezes will turn and blow from the south ahead of a cold front approaching from canada

she may appear to be acting in a silent film whose placards are
missing
in hollywood the sky is made of tin

a witch makes her world of air then fire then the planets
of
cardboard then ink then a compass
<|endoftext|>

she will know things she has not seen with her eyes
she will have

o loose bloom
with no root
no seed
<|endoftext|>

between my finger and my thumb
the squat pen rests
i'll dig with it
<|endoftext|>

as lightly as he touched the page before
where incarnation bloomed from roots that bore
the flowers i called christ's when i was four
<|endoftext|>

through the meridian's fine blue hairlines the admirals are converging
in their fish-hulled ships with their frogmen and sirens and tanks with knotted chain flails
that beat the ground before them as they crawl
<|endoftext|>

behind them the cities dim out on the foredeck the admirals sigh
to lean from the curving bows to trail
their fingertips in the water
<|endoftext|>

like compass pencils of light their fingertips spread out
the nervous systems more complex than spiral nebulae
orchards of mines grow up on the ocean floor

only the grassblown norman ringmounds go on dreaming
of monet picture hats and streaming scarves
the bunker disguised as a picnic that went on forever

i knew always that i would be a worker in the vineyard
as are all men and women living at the same time
whether they are aware of it or not
<|endoftext|>

but you must have hope and you must have faith
if you work if you wait you will find the place
where the four-leaf clovers grow
<|endoftext|>

or out with those crazy girls those teenagers laughing
on a christmas shopping spree free (the only day they
let us out in two months) feet wet and cold from snow
<|endoftext|>

occasionally lifting their eyes to watch the groundsmen at their antics
not just hope over experience but hope over certain knowledge
it was like staying to watch your horse lose
<|endoftext|>

and yet there was some residual sense of good fortune to be there
perhaps it was the fresh air or being safely out of range of conversation
or the infinitesimal prospect of infinitesimal entertainment
<|endoftext|>

he wondered about the word so filled with breath
yet breathless breathless breathless
a full stop
<|endoftext|>

son we were oak without
mouth uncut we were
brave before memory
<|endoftext|>

we will blaze forth
what remains
as pixels
<|endoftext|>

and so it somehow had to be
you did it for them
you erupted out of englishness and made an exhibition of yourself
<|endoftext|>

you are a joy forever though a thing of beauty nit
and from her madder eyebrows to her utmost purple swirl
against all captious critics i'll defend the poster girl
<|endoftext|>

to start over
in the carved moment
is to take cover
<|endoftext|>

alone
up a sidewalk
laid down for her
<|endoftext|>

please ease
of song
my tongue
<|endoftext|>

so the old miracle anew
and crumbs apportioned for a few
god-blessed suffice a multitude
<|endoftext|>

i dry dishes in the afternoon
watch her can apples from
the backyard put them in the cellar dark to save for winter
<|endoftext|>

this is a genuine transcription of the beautiful poem
the dance of the yangtze river valley
and the yangtze river

mn
i saw his eyes
i saw some old olive groves
<|endoftext|>

a
he he who lets nothing
is cut by his shadow and walks away
<|endoftext|>

mn
his words are white and unspeakable
his eyes deep and without sleep
<|endoftext|>

a
but the whole upper part of the stone was taken
and with it her name
<|endoftext|>

mn
i remember
it well
<|endoftext|>

mn
and from too many storms i've exited
self among humans exiled
<|endoftext|>

i have been one acquainted with the night
i have walked out in rain and back in rain
i have outwalked the furthest city light
<|endoftext|>

i have looked down the saddest city lane
i have passed by the watchman on his beat
and dropped my eyes unwilling to explain
<|endoftext|>

a page torn from a book
still blank for the two of us
a mother and her child
<|endoftext|>

savage and burning the barrow he circled
all without nor was any there
none in the waste
<|endoftext|>

' let reason say
the tomb shall close thy glittering day
the beggar prove thy equal there
<|endoftext|>

no she can't have no mattress
no she can't have no spoon
see if she throwed her food yet
<|endoftext|>

my mama was fifteen when she had me
that's common
in the country
<|endoftext|>

she is so sweet
you wouldn't believe she had did all the things they say
she did

mercy for praise to be forgiven for fame
he asked and hoped through christ
do thou the same
<|endoftext|>

if there were no wind we might we think hear
the earth grind on its axis or history
drip in darkness like a leaking pipe in the cellar
<|endoftext|>

then someone lifted you up
and there was a sound
and they laid you on me breathing
<|endoftext|>

restored to its rich owner  lying safely on his lap the money was mute again was superfluity and root and sum and symbol both lettuce and lump of all evil
she too approaching that state
yasmin a flower meantime dying
<|endoftext|>

gorgeous limber and free like our consciences
a law unto themselves a darker law to us
in their suntans our shadow
<|endoftext|>

upon such sacrifices the gods themselves shy clods
riffling the pages of sorrow and suffering
the president carefully lowers his hydrocephalic head onto the news he made
<|endoftext|>

making jazz swing in
seventeen syllables ain't

<|endoftext|>

she looked at him and tried to feel her way into the body
of a woman a thing which has to be taken care of held
safely in his arms
<|endoftext|>

with an impudent wag of the head
and he once went a walk paw-in-paw with a bear
just to keep up its spirits he said
<|endoftext|>

we have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks
but never as yet
have we caught the least glimpse of a snark
<|endoftext|>

we have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days
but a snark on the which we might lovingly gaze
we have never beheld till now
<|endoftext|>

you may charge me with murder or want of sense
but the slightest approach to a false pretence
was never among my crimes
<|endoftext|>

the jury had each formed a different view
and they all spoke at once so that none of them knew
one word that the others had said
<|endoftext|>

but while my thought runs on like this
with wasteful whims more than enough
i wonder what you're thinking of
<|endoftext|>

even so the leaves are curled apart
still red as from the broken heart
and here's the naked stem of thorns
<|endoftext|>

for love himself shall ripen these
in a kind of soil to just increase
through years of fertilizing peace
<|endoftext|>

and rank with interface of rut and rot
the month after the month they say is cruel
is and is not
<|endoftext|>

as for the devil when he has finished every imp
ersonation the best he will have been able to accomplish
is only that sound which is exactly not the music
<|endoftext|>

but in the earth and fire water and air
live earnestly by turns without despair
nor seek a home till home be every where
<|endoftext|>

' i fondly cried
secure with me thou may'st abide
till warmer suns appear
<|endoftext|>

for the listener who listens in the snow
and nothing himself beholds
nothing that is not there and the nothing that is
<|endoftext|>

where they chased the local mongoloid yelling stupid joey
stupid joey
now i've said everything nice i can about this
<|endoftext|>

the dark dark barks of the shark
boys
the cool juice of soweto
<|endoftext|>

it bowed as she left
and sat chastened by scales
wondering
<|endoftext|>

never-eldering revel and river of youth
what can it be this glee
the good you have there of your own
<|endoftext|>

but how shall i
make me room there
reach me a
<|endoftext|>

of course there is nothing the matter with the stars
it is my emptiness among them
while they drift farther away in the invisible morning
<|endoftext|>

the circles of the stormy moon
slide westward toward the river plate
death and the raven drift above
<|endoftext|>

stronger than memory
and weaker than dewdrops and i would have said
my identity is this expanse
<|endoftext|>

i attack and retreat like the violin in quatrains
i get far from my time when i am near
the topography of place
<|endoftext|>

there is no margin in modern language left
to celebrate what we love
because all that will be
<|endoftext|>

not because of anything
other than that the play was not written
skillfully
<|endoftext|>

water
binds me
to your name
<|endoftext|>

and we are now loosened
from the gravity of identity's land
what will we do
<|endoftext|>

what
will we do without exile and a long night
that stares at the water
<|endoftext|>

before i am lost
hell must open like a red rose
for the dead to pass
<|endoftext|>

cease gentle muse
the solemn gloom of night
now seals the fair creation from my sight
<|endoftext|>

i kissed a woman
whose freckles
aroused our neighbors
<|endoftext|>

she takes my toe
in her mouth
bites lightly
<|endoftext|>

speak not only of great devastation
so said my brother who could not write or read
but spent his days covered in other people's hair
<|endoftext|>

they are bombing his hospital office
but i am a ripe woman
a man could be happy
<|endoftext|>

i always thought reality
was something you became
when you grew up
<|endoftext|>

in the square stands fata morgana
looking tired shouting
morning paper morning paper
<|endoftext|>

with his ass and cart messiah crawls
and cries out: any old iron
any old shoes
<|endoftext|>

the mouth of the living is awash with spit it has enough to melt and wash within it
pigs and fish and cakes and still have enough to spit at friends
and the dead man's dry mouth has not enough to silently swallow the disgrace of his death
<|endoftext|>

and the dead man lay on his couch and the mold of a skeleton
was already drawn through the torn ends of his flesh
and his face is turned on high expectantly and waits for his daddy
<|endoftext|>

for he too the daddy is an orphan he too has no daddy
and he too wants why not to hide his face in his father's neck
and find there the consolations of his life and death
<|endoftext|>

and the dead man cried a desperate cry for his base life that was lost
and no one heard the dead man's awful moan
for it was choked in the hollow of his mouth that was stuffed with earth
<|endoftext|>

i just wishes i could talk more smarter theory no
i just wishes i could write more smarter poems no
i thinks why i am a poet and not a
<|endoftext|>

it could be all in the mind
anyway
nothing seems to bring it back to me
<|endoftext|>

i've had a long look at someone
alone like a key in a lock
without what it takes to turn
<|endoftext|>

my friend is smaller now and if i held my camera up
to her she would give off enough light to hover
pocket-sized in my hand and grand in the world
<|endoftext|>

and lilac water
and then
they would shoot me the grapes
<|endoftext|>

bored with perfecting my languid figure eights
i trailed him to a basement door marked gents
with its metal silhouette of high-laced skates
<|endoftext|>

time will break what doesn't
bend  even time
even you
<|endoftext|>

if only i could show you
how very useless
they are not
<|endoftext|>

nothing but silence and empty space
save in a corner a heap of dry leaves
that he's left for a bed to beggars or thieves
<|endoftext|>

all the time i pray to buddha
i keep on
killing mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>

feels shorter than the day
i first surmised the horses' heads
were toward eternity
<|endoftext|>

where can the dead hope
to stash some part
of themselves if not in the living
<|endoftext|>

your name to the squat gray
dog on wheels tipping on its side
as she drags it by a red string
<|endoftext|>

already i am becoming the valley
a soil that sprouts nothing
for any of us
<|endoftext|>

the sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays
and in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me
from the thick harvest that was not mine
<|endoftext|>

fog
if you go to your window
you will notice a fog drifting in
<|endoftext|>

woe to you watch out
you sons of bitches who would drive men and women
to the fields where they can only die
<|endoftext|>

even with insects
some can sing
some can't
<|endoftext|>

even if you are a puritan it would be all right
if you join the lovers in their ruined house tonight
it's good if you become a soul and then disappear
<|endoftext|>

i think of the path in space the thing has made since then
veering and halting of the shapes hands make
washing a car or in the uses of music
<|endoftext|>

broods for hours muttering putain
malaise on a loop
it never fades
<|endoftext|>

goes out
comes back
the love life of a cat
<|endoftext|>

his habits of mind aren't settled ossifying so slowly for many of us
we can't know and no one can tell him anything about cigarettes
bad drugs his fragile mortal spiral
<|endoftext|>

so far away we have
forgotten it
this is just a place
<|endoftext|>

i spent that evening clapping loudly in the garden
and come bedtime i was ready to write my long email
to the president of the united states of america
<|endoftext|>

it seems to be up to you
to keep us
up in the air and to make sure our paths never cross
<|endoftext|>

the scourge the spike a stab a shending bile the grace the quenching
mother who brought me here muddler:  open the window
let birds in

the moon came late to a lonesome bog
and there sat goggleky gluck the frog
' she cried and veiled her face
<|endoftext|>

mosquito at my ear

i'm deaf
<|endoftext|>

his curly-headed picture and mother's and medal's pictures
were all we knew of him after he rose again
those few electric jewels against the moth and whining sky
<|endoftext|>

the morning came up foolish with pink clouds
to say that god counts ours a cunning time
our losses part of an old secret somehow no loss
<|endoftext|>

answer
that you are here that life exists and identity
that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse
<|endoftext|>

horns
if we slow dance i will ask you not to tug
on them but secretly i will want that very much
<|endoftext|>

suddenly discovering in the eyes of the very beautiful
normande cocotte
the eyes of the very learned british museum assistant
<|endoftext|>

thus they in mutual accusation spent
the fruitless hours but neither self-condemning
and of thir vain contest appeer'd no end
<|endoftext|>

men in sleeveless undershirts
i'm listening for the philly sound
brother  brother  brotherly love
<|endoftext|>

but tell me
cal why did we live
why do we die
<|endoftext|>

i might discover nature is surprisingly
sometimes moral unexpected a principle
over which the lovers night and day quarrel

john cabot went down in the smoke and fire
and broken glass and blood and he cried lord

isn't it shocking how he speaks for her
his thin voice wavering across the restaurant
she'll have the cod artichoke bake
<|endoftext|>

or the word that brought us together as one
one i say now when i had felt myself many
speaking and listening: that was the contradiction
<|endoftext|>

the snow is melting
and the village is flooded
with children
<|endoftext|>

so i wouldn't touch their legs that kicked you
you pushed me under your chest
and i've never thanked you
<|endoftext|>

the loneliness now a lake
the privation now a lake
untouched and untraceable
<|endoftext|>

on whose forbidden ear
the distant strains of triumph
burst agonized and clear
<|endoftext|>

nobody wanted to touch me or
nobody who wanted to could reach me here
shaken like a screaming child under wet stairs
<|endoftext|>

rest from the ragged and rapid pulse the immediate threat
shot up in a disintegrating spray the many thoughts and
sights unmanageable the deaths of so many hungry or mad
<|endoftext|>

when it comes the landscape listens
when it goes 'tis like the distance
on the look of death
<|endoftext|>

seek'st thou the plashy brink
of weedy lake or marge of river wide
or where the rocking billows rise and sink
<|endoftext|>

executioners near the woman at the window
damn you elijah i'll bless jezebel tonight
damn you elijah

under the evening moon
the snail
is stripped to the waist

nothing falls under thine eyes eternal
sleep safe in dark soho: the stars are shining
titian and woodsworth live the people marches

of my bed i am waiting for them to come
under the covers i am the only person still in
this house there is no one here to look away
<|endoftext|>

the noise of a boat breaking up and its men is in our ears
the bottom here is too far down for our sounding
the ocean was salt before we crawled to tears

i'm counting on you to come through high water
to come through chaos and to action town
where we'll lift our aces to skyward aviation

other times sitting at the very center
of our garden googling beauty
with the filter off

very small and damaged and quite dry
a roman water nymph made of bone
tries to summon a river out of limestone

a tight-lipped man in a restaurant last night saying to me
kollwitz
she's too black-and-white
<|endoftext|>

of black grapes to each envoy
or a guest holding a dagger
behind his upright back
<|endoftext|>

drinking guinness followed by harvey wallbangers
vomiting it all up on pearse street
a guy from tuam holding my forehead
<|endoftext|>

when the air is true and simple we can watch him tremble
for an hour plucking his meaning from a handful of utterances
and then ascend into the terrible partition of speech

slipping their shiny
chrome along asphalt

love brought me down to death and death to hell
for god is just and death for sin is well
<|endoftext|>

i do not rage against his high decree
nor for myself do ask that grace shall be
but for my love on earth who mourns for me
<|endoftext|>

but still she wailed i pray thee let me go
i cannot rise to peace and leave him so
o let me soothe him in his bitter woe
<|endoftext|>

the brazen gates ground sullenly ajar
and upwards joyous like a rising star
she rose and vanished in the ether far
<|endoftext|>

but soon adown the dying sunset sailing
and like a wounded bird her pinions trailing

stately prows are rising and bowing

i never sought him in coquettish sport
or courted him as silly maidens court
and wonder when the longed-for prize falls short
<|endoftext|>

i only loved him any woman would
but shut my love up till he came and sued
then poured it o'er his dry life like a flood
<|endoftext|>

i was so happy i could make him blest
so happy that i was his first and best
as he mine when he took me to his breast
<|endoftext|>

or had he told me ere the deed was done
he only raised me to his heart's dear throne
poor substitute because the queen was gone
<|endoftext|>

so i built my house upon another's ground
mocked with a heart just caught at the rebound
a cankered thing that looked so firm and sound
<|endoftext|>

i say again he gives me all i claimed
i and my children never shall be shamed
he is a just man he will live unblamed
<|endoftext|>

and so my silent moan begins and ends
no world's laugh or world's taunt no pity of friends
or sneer of foes with this my torment blends
<|endoftext|>

the heart's first trouble and love's beginning
are all in her memory linked together
and now it is she herself that is spinning
<|endoftext|>

o how or by what means may i contrive
to bring the hour that brings thee back more near
how may i teach my drooping hope to live
<|endoftext|>

a thousand graces which shall thus be thine
so may my love and longing hallowed be
and thy dear thought an influence divine
<|endoftext|>

i have had playmates i have had companions
in my days of childhood in my joyful school-days
all all are gone the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

i have been laughing i have been carousing
drinking late sitting late with my bosom cronies
all all are gone the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

i loved a love once fairest among women
closed are her doors on me i must not see her
all all are gone the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

i have a friend a kinder friend has no man
like an ingrate i left my friend abruptly
left him to muse on the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

ghost-like i paced round the haunts of my childhood
earth seemed a desert i was bound to traverse
seeking to find the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

friend of my bosom thou more than a brother
why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling
so might we talk of the old familiar faces
<|endoftext|>

weep no more my lady o weep no more to-day
we'll sing one song for the old kentucky home
for our old kentucky home far away
<|endoftext|>

and the air undersings
the light stroke of their wings
and all life that approaches i wait for in fear
<|endoftext|>

o dark dark dark amid the blaze of moon
irrecoverably dark total eclipse
without all hope of day
<|endoftext|>

a sigh that piercing mortifies
a look that's fastened to the ground
a tongue chained up without a sound
<|endoftext|>

i loved my trees in order to dispose
i numbered peaches looked how stocks arose
told the same story oft in short began to prose
<|endoftext|>

here craving for a morsel of their bread
a pampered menial drove me from the door
to seek a shelter in the humble shed
<|endoftext|>

when we lay in the burning fever
on the mud of the cold clay floor
till you parted us all for three months squire
<|endoftext|>

i could get no more employment
the weather was bitter cold
the young ones cried and shivered
<|endoftext|>

take this long curl of yellow hair
and give it my father and tell him my prayer
my dying prayer was for him
<|endoftext|>

no night so wild but brings the constant sun
with love and power untold
no time so dark but through its woof there run

sweet sister help to stem the ebbing sea

dew-dropping melody in the carian's ear
first heaven then hell and then forgotten clear
vanish'd in elemental passion

not native in such barren vaults
give ear

put sleekly on one side with nicest care
and each one's gentle wrists with reverence

speechless they eyed each other and about
the fair assembly wander'd to and fro
distracted with the richest overflow
<|endoftext|>

all suddenly were silent
a soft blending
of dulcet instruments came charmingly
<|endoftext|>

thee gentle lady did he disenthral
ye shall for ever live and love for all
thy tears are flowing

the glinting snowdrifts lie
there is no voice or living sound

aye thus it is
heaven gleams and then is gone

for one boy's sake
a poor girl's heart must break
so sweet so true and yet it could not be

pitch and the flesh of the galileans
torches fit for a roman night

but sweet leonora with her love-lit eyes

and yet i think he loved me too my mood
was not unpleasant to him though i know
at times i teased him with my flickering talk
<|endoftext|>

tho' the biting north wind breaks
full across this drifted hold
watching westward as of old
<|endoftext|>

from fields far off whose watery hollows gleam
aye with blown throats that make the long hours sweet
the sleepless toads are murmuring in their dream
<|endoftext|>

and all day long i listen to the speech
i see far off beyond mine outer shore
the ocean flash and hear his harmless roar
<|endoftext|>

i repeat them as i heard them
from the lips of nawadaha
the musician the sweet singer
<|endoftext|>

master of life
he cried desponding
must our lives depend on these things
<|endoftext|>

you are but the pike kenozha
you are not the fish i wanted
you are not the king of fishes
<|endoftext|>

pleasant is the sound
he murmured
pleasant is the voice that calls me
<|endoftext|>

and the sisters and their husbands
laughed until the echoing forest
rang with their unseemly laughter
<|endoftext|>

hear him
said they hear the wise man
hear the plots of hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

ugh
the old men all responded
from their seats beneath the pine-trees
<|endoftext|>

thus was first made known to mortals
all the mystery of medamin
all the sacred art of healing
<|endoftext|>

`t was a youth of sixteen summers
`t was a nephew of iagoo
face-in-a-mist the people called him
<|endoftext|>

and the heron the shuh-shuh-gah
from her haunts among the fen-lands
screamed farewell o hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
and she thought of christ who stilled the wave
on the lake of galilee
<|endoftext|>

springtime ne'er denied
indoors by vernal chaucer whose fresh woods
throb thick with merle and mavis all the year
<|endoftext|>

what brings us thronging these high rites to pay
and seal these hours the noblest of our year
save that our brothers found this better way
<|endoftext|>

secure from change in their high-hearted ways
beautiful evermore and with the rays
of morn on their white shields of expectation
<|endoftext|>

we reck not what we gave thee
we will not dare to doubt thee
but ask whatever else and we will dare
<|endoftext|>

by bridge and ford by park and pale
all-armed i ride whate'er betide
until i find the holy grail
<|endoftext|>

one of six a willow pleiades
the seventh fallen that lean along the brink
where the steep upland dips into the marsh
<|endoftext|>

life's but a walking shadow a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more
<|endoftext|>

slowly sir launfal's eyes grew dim
slumber fell like a cloud on him
and into his soul the vision flew
<|endoftext|>

i ask no ampler skies than those
his magic music rears above me
no falser friends no truer foes
<|endoftext|>

around by lifting winds forgot
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
<|endoftext|>

once this soft turf this rivulet's sands
were trampled by a hurrying crowd
encountered in the battle-cloud
<|endoftext|>

strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
strange above all thy length of tress
and this all solemn silentness
<|endoftext|>

let him who fears before the foemen shout
or gives an inch before a vein has bled
turn on himself and let the traitor out
<|endoftext|>

it was the schooner hesperus
that sailed the wintry sea
to bear him company
<|endoftext|>

had sailed to the spanish main
i pray thee put into yonder port
for i fear a hurricane
<|endoftext|>

i never thought to ask i never knew
but in my simple ignorance suppose
the self-same power that brought me there brought you
<|endoftext|>

why say 'sail on
sail on
and on
<|endoftext|>

three roses wan as moonlight and weighed down
each with its loveliness as with a crown
drooped in a florist's window in a town
<|endoftext|>

oh i am bound for arcady
and if you but keep pace with me
you tread the way to arcady
<|endoftext|>

perchance in some still garden-place
where neither fount nor tree to-day is
he flung the jewel at the feet
<|endoftext|>

these are the days when birds come back
a very few a bird or two
to take a backward look
<|endoftext|>

these are the days when skies put on
the old old sophistries of june
a blue and gold mistake
<|endoftext|>

oh fraud that cannot cheat the bee
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief
<|endoftext|>

till ranks of seeds their witness bear
and softly through the altered air
hurries a timid leaf
<|endoftext|>

oh sacrament of summer days
oh last communion in the haze
permit a child to join
<|endoftext|>

thy sacred emblems to partake
thy consecrated bread to break
taste thine immortal wine
<|endoftext|>

all that thou art not makes not up the sum
all other voices wanting thine are dumb
all vision in thine absence vacancy
<|endoftext|>

two by two the sparrows build
high up in the orchard tree
anna anna anna won't you marry me
<|endoftext|>

for i am sure what e'er has been my lot
how meek how poor is more than i deserve
unto thy will i bow and murmur not
<|endoftext|>

day by darkling day
overpassing bears away
somewhat of the burden of this weary may
<|endoftext|>

night by numbered night
waning brings more near in sight
hope that grows to vision of my heart's delight
<|endoftext|>

nearer seems to burn
in the dawn's rekindling urn
flame of fragrant incense hailing his return
<|endoftext|>

louder seems each bird
in the brightening branches heard
still to speak some ever more delightful word
<|endoftext|>

all the mists that swim
round the dawns that grow less dim
still wax brighter and more bright with hope of him
<|endoftext|>

all the suns that rise
bring that day more near our eyes
when the sight of him shall clear our clouded skies
<|endoftext|>

all the winds that roam
fruitful fields or fruitless foam
blow the bright hour near that brings his bright face home
<|endoftext|>

if rain should come on peradventure
vain hope in us haply might venture
to dream as it did
<|endoftext|>

yea but yet is thy sun not set thy sunbright spirit of trust withdrawn
england's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears that fawn
hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon darkness dawn
<|endoftext|>

day by day of resurgent may salute the sun with sublime acclaim
change and brighten with hours that lighten and darken girdled with cloud or flame
earth's fair face in alternate grace beams blooms and lowers and is yet the same
<|endoftext|>

strong as time and as faith sublime clothed round with shadows of hopes and fears
nights and morrows and joys and sorrows alive with passion of prayers and tears
stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and waning years
<|endoftext|>

still the sun that beheld begun the work wrought here of unwearied hands
sees as then though the red king's men held ruthless rule over lawless lands
stand their massive design impassive pure and proud as a virgin stands
<|endoftext|>

skies fulfilled with the sundown stilled and splendid spread as a flower that spreads
pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven's the luminous oyster-beds
grass-embanked and in square plots ranked inlaid with gems that the sundown sheds
<|endoftext|>

squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine
warm and soft as the dome aloft but heavenlier yet than the sun's own shrine
heaven is high but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine
<|endoftext|>

rosy grey or as fiery spray full-plumed or greener than emerald gleams
plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory divine as dreams
lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems
<|endoftext|>

aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed
here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red
half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head
<|endoftext|>

higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs
east and west on the brave earth's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns
southward shining the lands declining subside in peace that the sea's light crowns
<|endoftext|>

westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace
fair as dawn's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land's face
eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race
<|endoftext|>

yet shall these when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights
rage rejoice and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites
felt and heard as a doomsman's word from seaward reaches to landward heights
<|endoftext|>

lift their heart up and take their part of triumph swollen and strong with rage
rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage
so their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age
<|endoftext|>

fame wherever her flag flew never forbore to fly with an equal wing
france and spain with their warrior train bowed down before her as thrall to king
india knelt at her feet and felt her sway more fruitful of life than spring
<|endoftext|>

darkness round them as iron bound fell off from races of elder name
slain at sight of her eyes whose light bids freedom lighten and burn as flame
night endures not the touch that cures of kingship tyrants and slaves of shame
<|endoftext|>

yet the might of her wings in flight whence glory lightens and music rings
loud and bright as the dawn's shall smite and still the discord of evil things
yet not slain by her radiant reign but darkened now by her sail-stretched wings
<|endoftext|>

music made of change and conquest glory born of evil slain
stilled the discord slew the darkness bade the lights of tempest wane
where the deathless dawn of england rose in sign that right should reign
<|endoftext|>

mercy where the tiger wallowed mad and blind with blood and lust
justice where the jackal yelped and fed and slaves allowed it just
rose as england's light on asia rose and smote them down to dust
<|endoftext|>

justice bright as mercy mercy girt by justice with her sword
smote and saved and raised and ruined till the tyrant-ridden horde
saw the lightning fade from heaven and knew the sun for god and lord
<|endoftext|>

where the footfall sounds of england where the smile of england shines
rings the tread and laughs the face of freedom fair as hope divines
days to be more brave than ours and lit by lordlier stars for signs
<|endoftext|>

earth and sea bear england witness if he lied who said it he
whom the winds that ward her waves that clasp and herb and flower and tree
fed with english dews and sunbeams hail as more than man may be
<|endoftext|>

no man ever spake as he that bade our england be but true
keep but faith with england fast and firm and none should bid her rue
none may speak as he: but all may know the sign that shakespeare knew
<|endoftext|>

and ever as time's flow brightened a river more dark than the storm-clothed sea
and age upon age rose fairer and larger in promise of hope set free
with england eton her child kept pace as a fostress of men to be
<|endoftext|>

still the reaches of the river still the light on field and hill
still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope's young fire to fill
shine and while the light of england lives shall shine for england still
<|endoftext|>

when four hundred more and fifty years have risen and shone and set
bright with names that men remember loud with names that men forget
haply here shall eton's record be what england finds it yet
<|endoftext|>

soon ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed us men
we too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon england then
life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a songless glen
<|endoftext|>

ah the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear
ah the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit the mounting cheer
lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear
<|endoftext|>

we that knew when the sun's shaft flew beheld and worshipped adored and heard
light rang round it of shining sound whence all men's hearts were subdued and stirred
joy love sorrow the day the morrow took life upon them in one man's word
<|endoftext|>

not for him can the years wax dim nor downward swerve on a darkening way
upward wind they and leave behind such light as lightens the front of may
fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day
<|endoftext|>

far above us and all our love beyond all reach of its voiceless praise
shines for ever the name that never shall feel the shade of the changeful days
fall and chill the delight that still sees winter's light on it shine like may's
<|endoftext|>

england glows as a sunlit rose from mead to mountain from sea to sea
bright with love and with pride above all taint of sorrow that needs must be
needs must live for an hour and give its rainbow's glory to lawn and lea
<|endoftext|>

not through tears shall the new-born years behold him crowned with applause of men
pass at last from a lustrous past to life that lightens beyond their ken
glad and dead and from earthward led to sunward guided of imogen
<|endoftext|>

frail
but fame's breath quickens kindles keeps in ward
life so sweet as this that dies and casts off death
<|endoftext|>

love should he wake bears now no cross for him
dead hope whose living eyes like his were dim
has brought forth better comfort strength more strong
<|endoftext|>

o loud and loud was the live man's cry
would god the dead and the slain were i
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

and women are fairest of a' things fair
but never shall i kiss woman mair
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

between the birk and the aik and the thorn
he's laid his brother to lie forlorn
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

between the bent and the burn and the broom
he's laid him to sleep till dawn of doom
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

his hair was yellow his cheek was red
when he set his face to the wind and fled
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

his banes were stark and his een were bright
when he set his face to the sea by night
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

o whatten a wreck wad they seek on land
that they houk the turf to the seaward hand
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

o whatten a prey wad they think to take
that they delve the dykes for a dead man's sake
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

for the dead was in wait now fifty year
and now shall i die for his blood's sake here
and the wind wears owre the heather
<|endoftext|>

storm and shame and fraud and darkness fill the nations full with night
hope and fear whose eyes yearn eastward have but fire and sword in sight
one alone whose name is one with glory sees and seeks the light
<|endoftext|>

hellas mother of the spirit sole supreme in war and peace
land of light whose word remembered bids all fear and sorrow cease
lives again while freedom lightens eastward yet for sons of greece
<|endoftext|>

greece where only men whose manhood was as godhead ever trod
bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her feet are shod
freedom armed of greece was always very man and very god
<|endoftext|>

now the winds of old that filled her sails with triumph when the fleet
bound for death from asia fled before them stricken wake to greet
ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of crete
<|endoftext|>

there was god born man the song that spake of old time said: and there
man made even as god by trust that shows him nought too dire to dare
now may light again the beacon lit when those we worship were
<|endoftext|>

though the tide that feels the west wind lift it wave by widening wave
wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save
none shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave
<|endoftext|>

in the sun-coloured mists of the sunrise and sunset that steam
as incense from urns of the twilight her portals ajar
let pass as a shadow the light of the sound of a dream
<|endoftext|>

the snake that felt thy heel upon her head
night's first-born writhes as though she were not dead
but strikes not stings not slays not as before
<|endoftext|>

the shadow shed round those we love shines bright
as love's own face when death sleep's gentler twin
from them divides us even as night from light
<|endoftext|>

his years were full: his years were joyous: why
must love be sorrow when his gracious name
recalls his lovely life of limb and eye
<|endoftext|>

a child's light hands whose touch makes flowers more fair
keep fair as these for many a march and may
the light of days that are because they were
<|endoftext|>

a babe's hands open as to greet
the tender touch of ours
and mock with motion faint and fleet
<|endoftext|>

what man would risk the danger twice
nor quake from head to heel
whom would not one such test suffice
<|endoftext|>

what heart of man dare hold the lists
against such odds and such
sweet vantage as no strength resists
<|endoftext|>

squadrons proud as their lords and loud with tramp of soldiers and chant of priests
slaves there told by the thousandfold made fast in bondage as herded beasts
lords and slaves that the sweet free waves shall feed on satiate with funeral feasts
<|endoftext|>

full july in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing morns
winds fall mild that of late waxed wild: no presage whispers or wails or warns
far to west on the bland sea's breast a sailing crescent uprears her horns
<|endoftext|>

but the lord of darkness the god whose love is a flaming fire
the master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire
he shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love not hire
<|endoftext|>

they shall fetter the wing of the wind whose pinions are plumed with foam
for now shall thy horn be exalted and now shall thy bolt strike home
yea now shall thy kingdom come lord god of the priests of rome
<|endoftext|>

they shall cast thy curb on the waters and bridle the waves of the sea
they shall say to her peace be still: and stillness and peace shall be
and the winds and the storms shall hear them and tremble and worship thee
<|endoftext|>

thy breath shall darken the morning and wither the mounting sun
and the daysprings frozen and fettered shall know thee and cease to run
the heart of the world shall feel thee and die and thy will be done
<|endoftext|>

the spirit of man that would sound thee and search out causes of things
shall shrink and subside and praise thee: and wisdom with plume-plucked wings
shall cower at thy feet and confess thee that none may fathom thy springs
<|endoftext|>

the fountains of song that await but the wind of an april to be
to burst the bonds of the winter and speak with the sound of a sea
the blast of thy mouth shall quench them: and song shall be only of thee
<|endoftext|>

the days that are dead shall quicken the seasons that were shall return
and the streets and the pastures of england the woods that burgeon and yearn
shall be whitened with ashes of women and children and men that burn
<|endoftext|>

yea so shall thy kingdom be stablished and so shall the signs of it be
and the world shall know and the wind shall speak and the sun shall see
that these are the works of thy servants whose works bear witness to thee
<|endoftext|>

but the dusk of the day falls fruitless whose light should have lit them on
sails flash through the gloom to shoreward eclipsed as the sun that shone
and the west wind wakes with dawn and the hope that was here is gone
<|endoftext|>

around they wheel and around two knots to the spaniard's one
the wind-swift warriors of england who shoot as with shafts of the sun
with fourfold shots for the spaniard's that spare not till day be done
<|endoftext|>

and the wind with the sundown sharpens and hurtles the ships to the lee
and spaniard on spaniard smites and shatters and yields and we
ere battle begin stand lords of the battle acclaimed of the sea
<|endoftext|>

and the day sweeps round to the nightward and heavy and hard the waves
roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons and masters and slaves
reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig their graves
<|endoftext|>

for the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of the seas
the graves that gape for their pasture and laugh thrilled through by the breeze
the sweet soft merciless waters await and are fain of these
<|endoftext|>

as the hiss of a python heaving in menace of doom to be
they hear through the clear night round them whose hours are as clouds that flee
the whisper of tempest sleeping the heave and the hiss of the sea
<|endoftext|>

but faith is theirs and with faith are they girded and helmed and shod
invincible are they almighty elect for a sword and a rod
invincible even as their god is omnipotent infinite god
<|endoftext|>

in him is their strength who have sworn that his glory shall wax not dim
in his name are their war-ships hallowed as mightiest of all that swim
the men that shall cope with these and conquer shall cast out him
<|endoftext|>

spain clings fast to thee spain aghast with anguish cries to thee where art thou
spain puts trust in thee lo the dust that soils and darkens her prostrate brow
spain is true to thy service who shall raise up spain for thy service now
<|endoftext|>

lords of night who would breathe your blight on april's morning and august's noon
god your lord the condemned the abhorred sinks hellward smitten with deathlike swoon
death's own dart in his hateful heart now thrills and night shall receive him soon
<|endoftext|>

god the devil thy reign of revel is here for ever eclipsed and fled
god the liar everlasting fire lays hold at last on thee hand and head
god the accurst the consuming thirst that burns thee never shall here be fed
<|endoftext|>

england queen of the waves whose green inviolate girdle enrings thee round
mother fair as the morning where is now the place of thy foemen found
still the sea that salutes us free proclaims them stricken acclaims thee crowned
<|endoftext|>

o hearts that strain and burn
as fires fast fettered burn and strain
bow down lie still and learn
<|endoftext|>

but heavens beyond us yearn
yea heights of heaven above the sway
of stars that eyes discern
<|endoftext|>

night sinks on the soul and the stars as they gleam
speak menace or mourning with tongues to reprove us
that we deemed of them better than terror may deem
<|endoftext|>

april made me: winter laid me here away asleep
bright as maytime was my daytime night is soft and deep
though the morrow bring forth sorrow well are ye that weep
<|endoftext|>

ye that held me dear beheld me not a twelvemonth long
all the while ye saw me smile ye knew not whence the song
came that made me smile and laid me here and wrought you wrong
<|endoftext|>

angels calling from your brawling world one undefiled
homeward bade me and forbade me here to rest beguiled
here i sleep not: pass and weep not here upon your child
<|endoftext|>

the love made strong with knowledge whence confirmed
the whole soul takes assurance and the past
lives present life and mingles first with last
<|endoftext|>

o mother where is my great green bed
silk at the foot and gold at the head
mother my mother
<|endoftext|>

she laid her cheek to the velvet and vair
one with another
she laid her arms up under her hair
<|endoftext|>

her gold hair fell through her arms fu' low
one with another
lord god bring me out of woe
<|endoftext|>

her gold hair fell in the gay reeds green
one with another
lord god bring me out of teen
<|endoftext|>

he kissed her down by her breast-flowers red
one with another
they were like river-flowers dead
<|endoftext|>

as all men's hearts grew godlike in one bird
and all those hearts cried on thee crying with might
hear us o mother night
<|endoftext|>

forgive me that with bitter words like his
i mix the gentlest english name that is
the tenderest held of all that know not death
<|endoftext|>

peace upon earth thou knewest not: now being dead
rest with nor curse nor blessing on thine head
where high-strung hate and strenuous envy cease
<|endoftext|>

first edition
reprinted
may
<|endoftext|>

oh never a doubt but somewhere i shall wake
and give what's left of love again and make
new friends now strangers
<|endoftext|>

where the first crocus buds unfold
we found these petals near the cold
swift river-bed
<|endoftext|>

beneath the rocks where ivy-frond
puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond
those lately dead
<|endoftext|>

never more will the wind
cherish you again
never more will the rain
<|endoftext|>

never more
shall we find you bright
in the snow and wind
<|endoftext|>

the snow is melted
the snow is gone
and you are flown
<|endoftext|>

like a bird out of our hand
like a light out of our heart
you are gone
<|endoftext|>

here in our wicker-trays
we bring the first faint blossoming
of fragrant bays
<|endoftext|>

(ah love
so her fair breasts will shine
with the faint shadow above
<|endoftext|>

from citron-bower be her bed
cut from branch of tree a-flower
fashioned for her maidenhead
<|endoftext|>

from lydian apples sweet of hue
cut the width of board and lathe
carve the feet from myrtle-wood
<|endoftext|>

let the palings of her bed
be quince and box-wood overlaid
with the scented bark of yew
<|endoftext|>

that all the wood in blossoming
may calm her heart and cool her blood
for losing of her maidenhood
<|endoftext|>

what of her
mistress of death
what of his kiss
<|endoftext|>

beauty is set apart
from the islands
and from greece
<|endoftext|>

in my garden
even the wind-flowers lie flat
broken by the wind at last
<|endoftext|>

what is rhodes crete
what is paros facing west
what white imbros
<|endoftext|>

flower sent to flower
for white hands the lesser white
less lovely of flower leaf
<|endoftext|>

can the spice-rose
drip such acrid fragrance
hardened in a leaf
<|endoftext|>

your lights are but dank shoals
slate and pebble and wet shells
and seaweed fastened to the rocks
<|endoftext|>

with the turn and grasp of your wrist
and the chords' stretch
there is a glint like worn brass
<|endoftext|>

life is a scavenger's pit i escape
i only rejecting it
lying here on this couch
<|endoftext|>

the house too was like this
over painted over lovely
the world is like this
<|endoftext|>

i have had enough
border-pinks clove-pinks wax-lilies
herbs sweet-cress
<|endoftext|>

treasure
spilled near the shrub-pines
to bleach on the boulders
<|endoftext|>

and the marsh dragged one back
and another perished under the cliff
and the tide swept you out
<|endoftext|>

you stood almost level
with the lance-bearers
and so slight
<|endoftext|>

you are clear
o rose cut in rock
hard as the descent of hail
<|endoftext|>

i could scrape the colour
from the petals
like spilt dye from a rock
<|endoftext|>

o wind rend open the heat
cut apart the heat
rend it to tatters
<|endoftext|>

i wondered at you
i shouted dear mysterious beautiful
white myrtle-flesh
<|endoftext|>

i was splintered and torn
the hill-path mounted
swifter than my feet
<|endoftext|>

have you heard o god seated on the cliff
how far toward the ledges of your house
how far i had to walk
<|endoftext|>

bear me to dictaeus
and to the steep slopes
to the river erymanthus
<|endoftext|>

as i pass down the corridor
past desperate faces at each cell
your eyes and my eyes may meet
<|endoftext|>

an old pond
and the sound of a frog leaping
into the water
<|endoftext|>

on the mountain-road
there is no flower more beautiful
than the wild violet
<|endoftext|>

there is faint sound of quavering strings
the reedy murmurs of a flute
the soft sigh of the wind through silken garments
<|endoftext|>

and the prince came to the craggy rock
but saw only hissing waves
so he rested all day amid them
<|endoftext|>

he dreams it is the murmur
of distant wave-caps breaking
upon the painted screen
<|endoftext|>

the peony dancer
swirls orange folds of dusty robes
through the summer
<|endoftext|>

heavy blooms
breaking and spilling fiery cups
drowsily
<|endoftext|>

faint rose anticipation colours her
and sunset
she is a cherry-tree that has taken long to bloom
<|endoftext|>

late summer changes to autumn
chrysanthemums are scattered
behind the palings
<|endoftext|>

far in the shadow
the daimyo's attendant waits
nervously fingering his sword
<|endoftext|>

wave on wave her heavy robes collapse
in green torrents
lashed with slaty foam
<|endoftext|>

downward the sun strikes amid them
and enkindles a lone flower
a violet iris standing yet in seething pools of grey
<|endoftext|>

swift waves hissing
under the moonlight
tarnished silver
<|endoftext|>

swaying boats
under the moonlight
gold lacquered prows
<|endoftext|>

she dreamed of some lover
to whom she might offer her body
fresh and cool as a flower born in the rain
<|endoftext|>

in their bark of bamboo reeds
the heavenly poetesses
float across the sky
<|endoftext|>

my thoughts are sparrows passing
through one great wave that breaks
in bubbles of gold on a black motionless rock
<|endoftext|>

in his face were written ages
of patient treachery
and the knowledge of his hour
<|endoftext|>

my love for her at first was like the smoke that drifts
across the marshes
from burning woods
<|endoftext|>

but after she had gone
it was like the lotus that lifts up
its heart shaped buds from the dim waters
<|endoftext|>

my heart is mournful as thunder moving
through distant hills
late on a long still night of autumn
<|endoftext|>

on my heart is the black badge of exile
i droop over it
i accept its shame
<|endoftext|>

through the weak spring rains
two lovers walk together
holding together the parasol
<|endoftext|>

spring rain falls through the cherry blossom
in long blue shafts
on grasses strewn with delicate stars
<|endoftext|>

the summer rain sifts through the drooping willow
shatters the courtyard
leaving grey pools
<|endoftext|>

the autumn rain drives through the maples
scarlet threads of sorrow
towards the snowy earth
<|endoftext|>

let my song sigh as the breeze through the cryptomerias
and pause like long flags flapping
and dart and flutter aloft like a wind-bewildered crane
<|endoftext|>

although there was no sound in all the house
i could not forbear listening for the cry of those long white rippling waves
dragging up their strength to break on the sullen beach of the sky
<|endoftext|>

the harmonies of the robes of this gay lady
are like chants within a temple sweeping outwards
to the morn
<|endoftext|>

sparrows and tame magpies chatter
in the porticoes
lit with many a lantern
<|endoftext|>

there is idle song
scandal over full wine cups
sorrow does not matter
<|endoftext|>

the green and violet peacocks
with golden tails
parade
<|endoftext|>

beneath the fluttering jangling streamers
they walk
violet and gold
<|endoftext|>

her life was like a swiftly rushing stream
green and scarlet
falling into darkness
<|endoftext|>

then in her heart they grew
the snows of changeless winter
stirred by the bitter winds of unsatisfied desire
<|endoftext|>

my thoughts are an autumn breeze
lifting and hurrying
dry rubbish about in a corner
<|endoftext|>

my thoughts are willow branches
already broken
motionless at twilight
<|endoftext|>

the wind shakes the mists
making them quiver
with faint drum-tones of thunder
<|endoftext|>

out of the crane-haunted mists of autumn
blue and brown
rolls the moon
<|endoftext|>

despair hangs in the broken folds of my garments
it clogs my footsteps
like snow in the cherry bloom
<|endoftext|>

pilgrims will ascend the road in early summer
passing my tombstone
mossy long forgotten
<|endoftext|>

because of the long pallid petals of white chrysanthemums
waving to and fro
i dare not go
<|endoftext|>

swallows twittering at twilight
waves of heat
churned to flames by the sun
<|endoftext|>

a piece of paper ready to toss in the fire
blackened scrawled with fragments of an incomplete song
my soul
<|endoftext|>

there is a goddess who walks shrouded by day
at night she throws her blue veil over the earth
men only see her naked glory through the little holes in the veil
<|endoftext|>

the splaying silhouette of horse-chestnut leaves
against the tall and delicate patrician-tinged sky
like a princess in blue robes behind a grille of bronze
<|endoftext|>

in that bower there is a chair
where doth sit the fairest fair
that did ever eye behold
<|endoftext|>

this is she the wise the rich
that the world desires to see
there is none but only she
<|endoftext|>

thus at base they run they run
when the sport was scarce begun
but i waked and all was done
<|endoftext|>

no i say and think and write it
write and think and say your pleasure
love and truth and i indite it
<|endoftext|>

and
and no man e'er
know why
<|endoftext|>

and now oh
now
i die
<|endoftext|>

mine eyes shall be th' interpreters alone
by them conceive my thoughts and tell me fair
if now you see her that doth love me there
<|endoftext|>

god shield the stock
if heaven send no supplies
the fairest blossom of the garden dies
<|endoftext|>

arthur held at camelot his christmas feast
with all the knights of the round table
full fifteen days
<|endoftext|>

the foal that he rode upon was green
sertayn
it was a steed full stiff to guide
<|endoftext|>

he asks for the governor of the company
gladly i wolde
raysoun
<|endoftext|>

he made non abode
meanwhile many a weary way goes sir gawayne
mony wylsum way he rode
<|endoftext|>

sir gawayne goes to the chief gate
in haste
and finds the draw-bridge raised and the gates shut fast
<|endoftext|>

whatsoever says the host i win in the wood shall be yours
and what check you achieve shall be mine
a bargain is made between them
<|endoftext|>

all this time gawayne lies a-bed
g
under coverture full clear
<|endoftext|>

the remembrance of his adventure prevents him from thinking of love
boute hone
the lady takes leave of sir gawayne
<|endoftext|>

thus gawayne defends himself
bot blysse
the lady having kissed the knight takes leave of him
<|endoftext|>

none durst approach him
he hade hurt so mony byforne
so many had he torn with his tusks
<|endoftext|>

full still and softly he sleeps all night
sir g: lis  slepes
early in the morning the lord is up
<|endoftext|>

after mass a morsel he take with his men
after messe a morsel he  his men token
then were all on their horses before the hall-gates
<|endoftext|>

for gile
sir gawayne swears by st
john that he neither has nor desires one
<|endoftext|>

with much mirth and minstrelsy they made merry
until the time came for them to part
gawayne takes leave of his host
<|endoftext|>

then he pursues his journey
rides through the dale and looks about
he sees no sign of a resting-place but only high and steep banks
<|endoftext|>

and addressed him as follows: bold knight be not so wroth
i promised thee a stroke and thou hast it be satisfied
i could have dealt worse with thee
<|endoftext|>

thus he comes to the court of king arthur
great then was the joy of all
the king and his knights ask him concerning his journey
<|endoftext|>

little mistress mine good-bye
i have been your sparrow true
dig my grave for i must die
<|endoftext|>

waste no tear and heave no sigh
life should still be blithe for you
little mistress mine good-bye
<|endoftext|>

in your garden let me lie
underneath the pointed yew
dig my grave for i must die
<|endoftext|>

we have loved the quiet sky
with its tender arch of blue
little mistress mine good-bye
<|endoftext|>

that i still may feel you nigh
in your virgin bosom too
dig my grave for i must die
<|endoftext|>

or on thy lips the fierce fond boy
marks with his teeth the furious joy
francis
<|endoftext|>

one than a goose's marrow softer far
comes hither stealing for it's penalty sake
steal he as please him: i will see him not
<|endoftext|>

a seasoned scrivener bred in office low
full often dupes and mocks the gaping crow
francis
<|endoftext|>

her pure and eloquent blood
spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought
that one would almost say her body thought
<|endoftext|>

sir wisdom's a fool when he's fou
sir knave is a fool in a session
but i am a fool by profession
<|endoftext|>

this list wi' my ain hand i wrote it
the day and date as under noted
then know all ye whom it concerns
<|endoftext|>

then howe'er crowns and coronets be rent
a virtuous populace may rise the while
and stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd isle
<|endoftext|>

but mete his cunning by the old scots ell
his meddling vanity a busy fiend
still making work his selfish craft must mend
<|endoftext|>

and in an instant all was dark
and scarcely had he maggie rallied
when out the hellish legion sallied
<|endoftext|>

gay pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er
and vow'd that to leave them he was quite forlorn
till cynthia hinted he'd find them next morn
<|endoftext|>

the gallant sir robert fought hard to the end
but who can with fate and quart-bumpers contend
though fate said a hero shall perish in light
<|endoftext|>

while virgin spring by eden's flood
unfolds her tender mantle green
or pranks the sod in frolic mood
<|endoftext|>

may bliss domestic smooth his private path
give energy to life and soothe his latest breath
with many a filial tear circling the bed of death
<|endoftext|>

sing on sweet thrush upon the leafless bough
sing on sweet bird i listen to thy strain
at thy blythe carol clears his furrow'd brow
<|endoftext|>

the friend whom wild from wisdom's way
the fumes of wine infuriate send
who but deplores that hapless friend
<|endoftext|>

simple wild enchanting elf
not to thee but thanks to nature
thou art acting but thyself
<|endoftext|>

since thou in all thy youth and charms
must bid the world adieu
to join the friendly few
<|endoftext|>

behind yon hills where lugar flows
the wintry sun the day has closed
and i'll awa to nannie o
<|endoftext|>

the devil has got the auld wife on his back
and like a poor pedlar he's carried his pack
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

then straight he makes fifty the pick o' his band
turn out on her guard in the clap of a hand
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

a reekit wee devil looks over the wa
o help master help or she'll ruin us a
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

the devil he swore by the edge o' his knife
he pitied the man that was tied to a wife
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

the devil he swore by the kirk and the bell
he was not in wedlock thank heav'n but in hell
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

then satan has travelled again wi' his pack
and to her auld husband he's carried her back
and the thyme it is wither'd and rue is in prime
<|endoftext|>

her voice is the song of the morning
that wakes thro' the green-spreading grove
on music and pleasure and love
<|endoftext|>

may cauld ne'er catch you but a hap
nor hunger but in plenty's lap
amen
<|endoftext|>

no scuptur'd marble here nor pompous lay
this simple stone directs pale scotia's way
to pour her sorrows o'er her poet's dust
<|endoftext|>

dark as was chaos ere the infant sun
was roll'd together or had tried his beams
athwart the gloom profound
<|endoftext|>

rude am i in speech
and therefore little can i grace my cause
in speaking for myself
<|endoftext|>

rude am i in my speech
and little therefore shall i grace my cause
in speaking for myself
<|endoftext|>

dark as was chaos ere the infant sun
was roll'd together or had try'd his beams
athwart their gloom profound
<|endoftext|>

vapours and clouds and storms
until he terrify himself
at combustion of his own raising
<|endoftext|>

tell us ye dead
will none of you in pity disclose the secret
what 'tis you are and we must shortly be
<|endoftext|>

attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds
and offices of life to life itself
with all its vain and transient joys sit loose
<|endoftext|>

oh there beyond expression blest
i'd feast on beauty a' the night
seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest
<|endoftext|>

but for my secret thoughts which i withhold
from all in heaven beside them search not thou
with irksome curiosity and vain
<|endoftext|>

arriving at the hosts of greece and troy
they left the chariot and proceeded both
into the interval between the hosts
<|endoftext|>

for never since the day when thee i bore
thy beauty loved i as i love thee now
or felt such sweetness of intense desire
<|endoftext|>

so elephenor fell for whom arose
sharp conflict greeks and trojans mutual flew
like wolves to battle and man grappled man
<|endoftext|>

let none desirous of the spoil his time
devote to plunder now now slay your foes
and strip them when the field shall be your own
<|endoftext|>

the steeds beside the chariots stood their corn
chewing and waiting till the golden-throned
aurora should restore the light of day
<|endoftext|>

these will i give and will with these resign
most solemn that unconscious as she was
of my embraces such i yield her his
<|endoftext|>

these will he give and will with these resign
most solemn that unconscious as she was
of his embraces such he yields her back
<|endoftext|>

son of bold tydeus
think on thy return
to yonder fleet lest thou depart constrain'd
<|endoftext|>

we are three brothers saturn is our sire
and rhea brought us forth first jove she bore
me next then pluto sovereign of the shades
<|endoftext|>

as when the east wind and the south contend
to shake some deep wood on the mountain's side
or beech or ash or rugged cornel old
<|endoftext|>

for when patroclus fell the friend was slain
of such a chief as is not in the fleet
for valor and his bands are dauntless all
<|endoftext|>

much radiant armor round about the foss
fell of the flying grecians or within
lay scatter'd and no pause of war they found
<|endoftext|>

patroclus is no more
the grecians fight
for his bare corse and hector hath his arms
<|endoftext|>

she like a falcon from the snowy top
stoop'd of olympus bearing to the earth
the dazzling wonder fresh from vulcan's hand
<|endoftext|>

thou wilt be found false and this word of thine
shall want performance
but olympian jove
<|endoftext|>

atrides
most illustrious
king of men
<|endoftext|>

the tongue of man is voluble hath words
for every theme nor wants wide field and long
and as he speaks so shall he hear again
<|endoftext|>

haste follow her ah shameless
how she leads
gore-tainted mars through all the host of heaven
<|endoftext|>

i call for two brave warriors arm'd to prove
each other's skill with weapons keen this prize
disputing next in presence of us all
<|endoftext|>

but i ere yet the city i behold
taken and pillaged with these aged eyes
shall find safe hiding in the shades below
<|endoftext|>

so saying he waken'd in his soul regret
of his own sire softly he placed his hand
on priam's hand and push'd him gently away
<|endoftext|>

then in the vestibule the herald slept
and priam prudent both but peleus' son
in the interior tent and at his side
<|endoftext|>

the tomb once heap'd assembling all again
within the palace they a banquet shared
magnificent by godlike priam given
<|endoftext|>

part huge of bulk
wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait
tempest the ocean
<|endoftext|>

for i deem
him wont to pray since all of every land
need succor from the gods
<|endoftext|>

it hath commodious havens into which
a passage clear opens on either side
and there the ambush'd greeks his coming watch'd

nothing except his surname appears recoverable with regard to the author
of this truly noble poem: it should be noted as exhibiting a rare
excellence the climax of simple sublimity
<|endoftext|>

that to find in chapman's homer the pure serene of the original the
reader must bring with him the imagination of the youthful poet he
must be a greek himself as shelley finely said of keats
<|endoftext|>

the editor in this and in other instances has risked the addition (or
the change) of a title that the aim of the verses following may be
grasped more clearly and immediately
<|endoftext|>

this poem has an exaltation and a glory joined with an exquisiteness of
expression which place it in the highest rank amongst the many
masterpieces of its illustrious author
<|endoftext|>

this impassioned address expresses shelley's most rapt imaginations and
is the direct modern representative of the feeling which led the greeks
to the worship of nature

mainly on oyster-patties said the blue-bottle-fly and
when these are scarce on raspberry vinegar and russian leather
boiled down to a jelly
<|endoftext|>

blue-bottle-flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor while all
nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous
circumstances
<|endoftext|>

on which violet who was perfectly acquainted with the art of
mitten-making said to the crabs do your claws unscrew or are
they fixtures
<|endoftext|>

so remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very
deeply and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong
sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite
<|endoftext|>

as for the rhinoceros in token of their grateful adherence they
had him killed and stuffed directly and then set him up outside
the door of their father's house as a diaphanous doorscraper
<|endoftext|>

the parrots lived upon the soffsky-poffsky trees which were
beautiful to behold and covered with blue leaves and they
fed upon fruit artichokes and striped beetles
<|endoftext|>

one day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the
seven families agreed that they would send their children
out to see the world
<|endoftext|>

so they called them all together and gave them each eight
shillings and some good advice some chocolate-drops and a small
green morocco pocket-book to set down their expenses in
<|endoftext|>

and the old fishes said above all things avoid eating a blue
boss-woss for they do not agree with fishes and give them a pain
in their toes
<|endoftext|>

so all the children of each family thanked their parents and
making in all forty-nine polite bows they went into the wide
world
<|endoftext|>

when the seven young geese began to travel they went over
a large plain on which there was but one tree and that was
a very bad one
<|endoftext|>

so after a time all the seven young geese said to each
other beyond all doubt this beast must be a plum-pudding
flea
<|endoftext|>

when the seven young owls set out they sate every now and
then on the branches of old trees and never went far at
one time
<|endoftext|>

and one night when it was quite dark they thought they heard
a mouse but as the gas-lamps were not lighted they could not
see him
<|endoftext|>

cover them with water and boil them for hours incessantly
after which add pints of new milk and proceed to boil for
hours more
<|endoftext|>

when you have ascertained that the amblongusses are quite
soft take them out and place them in a wide pan taking care to
shake them well previously
<|endoftext|>

grate some nutmeg over the surface and cover them carefully
with powdered gingerbread curry-powder and a sufficient quantity
of cayenne pepper
<|endoftext|>

then having prepared the paste insert the whole carefully
adding at the same time a small pigeon  slices of beef  cauliflowers
and any number of oysters
<|endoftext|>

procure some strips of beef and having cut them into the
smallest possible slices proceed to cut them still smaller
eight or perhaps nine times
<|endoftext|>

when the whole is thus minced brush it up hastily with a new
clothes-brush and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon
or a soup-ladle
<|endoftext|>

place the whole in a saucepan and remove it to a sunny place
say the roof of the house if free from sparrows or other birds
and leave it there for about a week
<|endoftext|>

visit the paste and beat the pig alternately for some days and
ascertain if at the end of that period the whole is about to turn
into gosky patties
<|endoftext|>

if it does not then it never will and in that case the pig
may be let loose and the whole process may be considered as
finished
<|endoftext|>

x was king xerxes
who wore on his head a mighty large turban
green yellow and red
<|endoftext|>

and he said to himself as he bolted the door
i will not wear a similar dress any more
any more any more any more never more

they sought in vain for even a bone

the book should be useful and welcomed too not only by the classroom
teacher but also by the specialist and supervisor of physical
education
<|endoftext|>

there is need for a manual of this type in our physical training
literature and it is hoped that this material will be used generally
throughout the schools of our country
<|endoftext|>

the author wishes to express thanks to miss louise westwood
director of music of the newark public schools for the following
suggestions as to the teaching of the song element

first word being given using the pitch-pipe to get the key in which the
song is written

for and though many were received it is stated that no brilliant
results were among them

tell me whither i may his me tell me dear one that i may know
is it up the highest andes
down a horrible volcano
<|endoftext|>

and he chirped and sang and skipped about and laughed with
laughter hearty
he was wonderfully active for so very stout a party
<|endoftext|>

found at last
i madly shouted
gentle pieman you astound me
<|endoftext|>

and i shouted and i danced until he'd quite a crowd around him
and i rushed away exclaiming i have found him
i have found him
<|endoftext|>

a glimmering thought occurs to me
but i've a kind of notion we
were cruelly changed at birth
<|endoftext|>

o billy
we're going to kill and eat you
so undo the button of your chemie
<|endoftext|>

ho
reef the maintop-gallant-tree
with many a running block
<|endoftext|>

'they stirred their stumps they spiked the pumps
they spliced the mizzen brace
aloft and alow they worked but oh
<|endoftext|>

alas
and alas
has it come to this pass
<|endoftext|>

of course 't was a sensible thing to do
for little peetookle is spared the strain
of the rollicking mastodon over in spain
<|endoftext|>

poor thing
you know she's growing old
and hasn't any folk
<|endoftext|>

sir
she exclaimed how can you try
an honest moon this way
<|endoftext|>

for all your jeering speeches
at duty's call i left my legs
in badajos's breaches
<|endoftext|>

the gentleman then took his cane which lay by his side as he sat
and he dropped in the river his wig in attempting to get out his
hat
<|endoftext|>

his head being thicker than common o'er-balanced the rest of his
fat
and in plumped this son of a woman to follow his wig cane and hat
<|endoftext|>

o it is not for the mellow chestnut
that i so far am come
nor yet for puckery cherries but
<|endoftext|>

a blossom hangs the choke-cherry
and eke the chestnut burr
and thou a silly fowl must be
<|endoftext|>

nor in the forest go
there lurks beneath his bosky tent
the deadly mosquito
<|endoftext|>

the wooden-chuck is next of kin
i fear not thine ill-boding din
and why should i fear her
<|endoftext|>

o rarely blooms the cypripe
and like a torch it shines to me
adown the dark wood-walk
<|endoftext|>

the bark upon the tree
thou at thy will mayst peck and bore
but peck and bore not me
<|endoftext|>

full two long hours i've searched about
and 't would in sooth be rum
if i should now go back without
<|endoftext|>

loud flouted there that student wight
solche warnynge for to hear
i scorn old hen thy threats of might
<|endoftext|>

the wood-peck turned to whet her beak
the student heard her drum
as through the wood he went to seek
<|endoftext|>

alas
the evening bell did ring
and down the walk the freshmen went
<|endoftext|>

ye muses pour the pitying tear
for pollio snatch'd away
for had he liv'd another year
<|endoftext|>

o were he born to bless mankind
in virtuous times of yore
heroes themselves had fallen behind
<|endoftext|>

how sad the groves and plains appear
and sympathetic sheep
even pitying hills would drop a tear
<|endoftext|>

his bounty in exalted strain
each bard might well display
since none implor'd relief in vain
<|endoftext|>

and hark
i hear the tuneful throng
his obsequies forbid
<|endoftext|>

yet 't is said that his death
was occasioned at last
by the loss of his breath
<|endoftext|>

i can't recall his name
or what he used to do
but then well such is fame
<|endoftext|>

o golfer be quiet and mark where it scuds
and think of its paces of owners and races
relinquish the links for the study of studs
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

or only a trifle bigger
than the elves who surround the throne
by mortals in dreams alone
<|endoftext|>

or why did we twain abscond
all breakfastless too from the public view
to prowl by a misty pond
<|endoftext|>

or her uncle
i can't make out
ask your governess dears or tutor
<|endoftext|>

for myself i'm in hopeless doubt
as to why we were there and who on earth we were
and what this is all about
<|endoftext|>

such sir are all the facts succinctly put
the basis or substratum what you will
of the impending eighty thousand lines
<|endoftext|>

boats were curtseying rising bowing
and sands were a ribbon of green endowing
and o the sun-dazzle on bark and bight
<|endoftext|>

the trees that grow upon the shore

so long there is no knowing

he loiters with the briar rose
the blue-belles are his play-fellows
that dance upon their slender stem
<|endoftext|>

and i have said my little will
why should not he continue still
a thing of nature's rearing
<|endoftext|>

a thing beyond the world's control
a living vegetable soul
no human sorrow fearing
<|endoftext|>

it were a blessed sight to see
that child become a willow-tree
his brother trees among
<|endoftext|>

and we all kicked off from the gasworks end with a yoicks
and a

ran clean through his lee and beat him twice with a lob
<|endoftext|>

deuce vantage check
by neck and neck we rounded into the

<|endoftext|>

hand over hand by the members' stand i lifted and eased her up
shot clean and fair to the crossbar there and landed the
jubilee cup
<|endoftext|>

the odd by a head and leg before so the judge he gave the word
and the umpire shouted over
but i neither spoke nor stirred
<|endoftext|>

they crowded round: for there on the ground i lay in a dead-cold
swoon
pitched neck and crop on the turf atop of my beautiful wooden spoon
<|endoftext|>

the auld wife sat at her ivied door
a thing she had frequently done before
and her spectacles lay on her aproned knees
<|endoftext|>

the piper he piped on the hill-top high
till the cow said i die and the goose asked why
and the dog said nothing but searched for fleas
<|endoftext|>

the farmer he strode through the square farmyard
his last brew of ale was a trifle hard
the connection of which with the plot one sees
<|endoftext|>

the farmer's daughter hath frank blue eyes
she hears the rooks caw in the windy skies
as she sits at her lattice and shells her peas
<|endoftext|>

the farmer's daughter hath ripe red lips
if you try to approach her away she skips
over tables and chairs with apparent ease
<|endoftext|>

the farmer's daughter hath soft brown hair
and i met with a ballad i can't say where
which wholly consisted of lines like these
<|endoftext|>

she sat with her hands 'neath her crimson cheeks
she gave up mending her father's breeks
and let the cat roll in her best chemise
<|endoftext|>

she sat with her hands 'neath her burning cheeks
and gazed at the piper for thirteen weeks
then she followed him out o'er the misty leas
<|endoftext|>

her sheep followed her as their tails did them
and this song is considered a perfect gem
and as to the meaning it's what you please
<|endoftext|>

two bright stars
peep'd into the shell
what are they dreaming of
<|endoftext|>

alas
my child where is the pen
that can do justice to the hen
<|endoftext|>

children behold the chimpanzee
he sits on the ancestral tree
from which we sprang in ages gone
<|endoftext|>

i'm glad we sprang: had we held on
we might for aught that i can say
be horrid chimpanzees today
<|endoftext|>

this creature (don't say 'cuss ' my child
'tis slang) this creature fierce is styled
the hippopotamus
<|endoftext|>

the river's plain enough of course
but why they called that thing a horse
that's what is greek to me
<|endoftext|>

this vacillating thing you see
could not decide which he would be
fish flesh or fowl and chose all three
<|endoftext|>

oh
tell me did you ever see a bird so funny stand-o
when forth he from the water comes and gets upon the land-o
<|endoftext|>

no
in my life i ne'er did see a bird so funny stand-o
when forth he from the water comes and gets upon the land-o
<|endoftext|>

and think this length of neck and legs (no doubt they have their
uses
are members of a little frame much smaller than a goose's
<|endoftext|>

keep open ear for subtle signs
thus when the cow profusely moans
that means to say the lion dines
<|endoftext|>

the crunching sound of course is bones
silence resumes her ancient reign
this shows the cow is out of pain
<|endoftext|>

a tartar who dwells on the plains of thibet
has for centuries made it a nursery pet
and surely the tartar should know
<|endoftext|>

then tell your papa where the yak can be got
and if he is awfully rich
he will buy you the creature or else he will not
<|endoftext|>

a python i should not advise
it needs a doctor for its eyes
and has the measles yearly
<|endoftext|>

however if you feel inclined
to get one (to improve your mind
and not from fashion merely
<|endoftext|>

allow no music near its cage
and when it flies into a rage
chastise it most severely
<|endoftext|>

i had an aunt in yucatan
who bought a python from a man
and kept it for a pet
<|endoftext|>

she died because she never knew
these simple little rules and few
the snake is living yet
<|endoftext|>

be kind to the badger
for who shall decide
the depths of his badgerly soul
<|endoftext|>

be kind to the ostrich
for how canst thou hope
to have such a stomach as it
<|endoftext|>

there was a frog swum in the lake
the crab came crawling by
wilt thou coth the frog be my make
<|endoftext|>

tell me then spake the crab therefore
or else i thee defy
give me thy claw i ask no more
<|endoftext|>

and do fish bite
the horrid things
indeed i'll not catch one
<|endoftext|>

and now it's taken wing
i s'pose no man before or since
dreamt such a funny thing
<|endoftext|>

shalott

does he sail about on an inland lake

tears shed
tears shed like water
your great ahkoond is dead
<|endoftext|>

though earthly walls his frame surround
and sceptics mock the lowly mound
and say he's now of no ahkoond
<|endoftext|>

his soul is in the skies
the azure skies that bend above his loved
metropolis of swat
<|endoftext|>

he sees with larger other eyes
athwart all earthly mysteries
he knows what's swat

the monkey married the baboon's sister

white gauze veil and a green glass breast-pin

i used to be very fond of fishing and of a sunday morning
i have been out before the sun delving for worms in some old
weed-blanketed dunghill and steering off across the wet grain
<|endoftext|>

one of these few old books was thomson's seasons which gave
a direction to the poetic instincts of clare already manifesting
themselves in scribbled verses in his exercise-books
<|endoftext|>

the publishers' own account furnished only through clare's repeated
demands in or thereabouts has a sobering tale to tell: but so
far no biographer has condescended to examine it
<|endoftext|>

this money if actually paid had been paid in against him also is
charged a curious commission p
cent
<|endoftext|>

clare asked time to reflect
a week later against the wish of allan
cunningham he accepted the scheme
<|endoftext|>

and then the charm vanishes into the vanity that i shall do something
better ere i die and so in spite of myself i rhyme on and write
nothing but little things at last
<|endoftext|>

and peace
where can its happiness abound
no where at all save heaven and the grave
<|endoftext|>

and o dear what shall i do
when nobody whispers to marry me
nobody cometh to woo
<|endoftext|>

what is there in those distant hills
my fancy longs to see
that many a mood of joy instils
<|endoftext|>

such men are common here
and pastoral maidens milking cows
are dwelling everywhere
<|endoftext|>

cold though the winter blow
when hills are free from snow
it will be spring again
<|endoftext|>

and for my freedom's sake
with such i'll pattern take
and rove and revel on
<|endoftext|>

your gall shall never make
me honied paths forsake
so prythee get thee gone
<|endoftext|>

what pleasures crowd its ways
that man should take such pains
to seek them all his days
<|endoftext|>

judge not thou deal'st in joy
its flowers but hide the asp
thy revels to destroy
<|endoftext|>

there speckled thrush by self-delight embued
there sings unto himself for joy's amends
and drinks the honey dew of solitude
<|endoftext|>

here poor integrity can sit at ease
and list self-satisfied
the song of honey-bees

now homeward-bound the hedger bundles round
his evening faggot and with every stride
his leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound

how sweet the soothing calm that smoothly stills

we can hardly imagine that the religious experience of mankind will

that the broad ocean in that hole should lie

confine the ocean in this tiny pit

the strong gods pine for my abode

your strength your speed your fury and your joy

<|endoftext|>

should the dead sepulchre imbue
with vital odors through and through
't was all their love had leave to do
<|endoftext|>

they counted not as waste that day
what they had brought their lord
the way
<|endoftext|>

through tragic darkness murk and dim
where'er they see the faintest rim
of promise all for sake of him
<|endoftext|>

myrrh-bearers still at home abroad
what paths have holy women trod
burdened with votive gifts for god
<|endoftext|>

rare gifts whose chiefest worth was priced
by this one thought that all sufficed
their spices had been bruised for christ
<|endoftext|>

abide with me
fast falls the eventide
the darkness deepens: lord with me abide
<|endoftext|>

but as thou dwelt with thy disciples lord
familiar condescending patient free
come not to sojourn but abide with me
<|endoftext|>

in vain thou strugglest to get free
i never will unloose my hold
art thou the man that died for me
<|endoftext|>

the secret of thy love unfold
wrestling i will not let thee go
till i thy name thy nature know
<|endoftext|>

what sudden blaze is round him poured
as though all heaven's refulgent hoard
in one rich glory shone
<|endoftext|>

one moment and to earth he falls
what voice his inmost heart appalls
voice heard by him alone
<|endoftext|>

know though at god's right hand i live
i feel each wound ye reckless give
to the least saint below
<|endoftext|>

i in your care my brethren left
not willing ye should be bereft
of waiting on your lord
<|endoftext|>

the meanest offering ye can make
a drop of water for love's sake
in heaven be sure is stored
<|endoftext|>

nevermore from wind or tide
nevermore from billow's roll
wilt thou need thyself to hide
<|endoftext|>

no that door is hard to open
hinges rusty latch is broken
bid him go
<|endoftext|>

ah that door
why wilt thou vex me
coming ever to perplex me
<|endoftext|>

did she open
doth she
will she
<|endoftext|>

how oft my guardian angel gently cried
soul from thy casement look and thou shalt see
how he persists to knock and wait for thee
<|endoftext|>

and o how often to that voice of sorrow
to-morrow we will open
i replied
<|endoftext|>

ye nymphs of solyma
begin the song
to heavenly themes sublimer strains belong
<|endoftext|>

ye heavens
from high the dewy nectar pour
and in soft silence shed the kindly shower
<|endoftext|>

a god a god
the vocal hills reply
the rocks proclaim th' approaching deity
<|endoftext|>

then palaces shall rise the joyful son
shall finish what his short-lived sire begun
their vines a shadow to their race shall yield
<|endoftext|>

to the throne the trumpet sounding
through the sepulchres resounding
summons all with voice astounding
<|endoftext|>

on the written volume's pages
life is shown in all its stages
judgment-record of past ages
<|endoftext|>

sits the judge the raised arraigning
darkest mysteries explaining
nothing unavenged remaining
<|endoftext|>

what shall i then say unfriended
by no advocate attended
when the just are scarce defended
<|endoftext|>

king of majesty tremendous
by thy saving grace defend us
fount of pity safety send us
<|endoftext|>

holy jesus meek forbearing
for my sins the death-crown wearing
save me in that day despairing
<|endoftext|>

worn and weary thou hast sought me
by thy cross and passion bought me
spare the hope thy labors brought me
<|endoftext|>

righteous judge of retribution
give o give me absolution
ere the day of dissolution
<|endoftext|>

in my prayers no worth discerning
yet on me thy favor turning
save me from that endless burning
<|endoftext|>

when the wicked are rejected
and by bitter flames subjected
call me forth with thine elected

the world's foundations first were laid

<|endoftext|>

come pour thy joys on human kind
from sin and sorrow set us free
and make thy temples worthy thee
<|endoftext|>

our hearts with heavenly love inspire
come and thy sacred unction bring
to sanctify us while we sing
<|endoftext|>

proceeding spirit our defence
who dost the gifts of tongues dispense
and crown'st thy gift with eloquence
<|endoftext|>

come father of the poor to earth
come with thy gifts of precious worth
come light of all of mortal birth
<|endoftext|>

come thou in whom our toil is sweet
our shadow in the noonday heat
before whom mourning flieth fleet
<|endoftext|>

whate'er without thy aid is wrought
or skilful deed or wisest thought
god counts it vain and merely naught
<|endoftext|>

thy will be ours in all our ways
o melt the frozen with thy rays
call home the lost in error's maze
<|endoftext|>

and grant us lord who cry to thee
and hold the faith in unity
thy precious gifts of charity
<|endoftext|>

that we may live in holiness
and find in death our happiness
and dwell with thee in lasting bliss
<|endoftext|>

o purest fountain
we can see clear mirrored in thy streams
that god brings home the wanderers that god the lost redeems
<|endoftext|>

in every hour while life is spared to thee
in crowds or solitudes in joy or care
thy thoughts should heavenward flee
<|endoftext|>

oh hour of bliss
when the heart o'erflows
with rapture a mother only knows
<|endoftext|>

awake awake
and gird up thy strength
to join that holy band at length
<|endoftext|>

for who can tell when sleep thine eyes shall close
that earthly cares and woes
to thee may e'er return
<|endoftext|>

has thy day been so bright
that in its flight
there is no trace of sorrow
<|endoftext|>

thou fool
this very night
thy soul may wing its flight
<|endoftext|>

that cannot be: since i am still possessed
of those effects for which i did the murder
my crown mine own ambition and my queen

words without thoughts never to heaven go

my name is satan rise

loud laughed the fiend
you know me well
therefore my purpose i will tell
<|endoftext|>

darkness is thinning shadows are retreating
morning and light are coming in their beauty
suppliant seek we with an earnest outcry
<|endoftext|>

father and son and holy spirit give us
whom through the wide world celebrate forever
blessing and glory
<|endoftext|>

o let the false dream fly
where our sick souls do lie
tossing continually
<|endoftext|>

o god i cannot walk the way
the thorns the thirst the darkness
and bleeding feet and aching heart
<|endoftext|>

i hear the songs and revels of the throng
they sneer upon my downcast face with scorn
yet o my god i must and shall walk with thee
<|endoftext|>

it ploughs my soul with ploughshares flaming hot
yet give me truth
i must have truth o god
<|endoftext|>

let this be something in thy sight
i have not in the slothful dark
forgot the vision and the height
<|endoftext|>

oh
when shall all my wand'rings end
and all my steps to-thee-ward tend
<|endoftext|>

ah
tear it thence and reign alone
the lord of every motion there
<|endoftext|>

oh
hide this self from me that i
no more but christ in me may live
<|endoftext|>

ah
no ne'er will i backward turn
thine wholly thine alone i am
<|endoftext|>

oh
help that i may never move
from the blest footsteps of thy love
<|endoftext|>

little hast thou bestead
save to perplex the head
and leave the spirit dead
<|endoftext|>

from the recesses of a lowly spirit
our humble prayer ascends o father
hear it
<|endoftext|>

who hast within thine equal heed
the rolling sun the ripening seed
the azure of the speedwell's eye
<|endoftext|>

it is not wisdom to be only wise
and on the inward vision close the eyes
but it is wisdom to believe the heart
<|endoftext|>

our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
that lights the pathway but one step ahead
across a void of mystery and dread
<|endoftext|>

bid then the tender light of faith to shine
by which alone the mortal heart is led
unto the thinking of the thought divine
<|endoftext|>

all weakness i
on him rely
who fixed the earth and spread the starry sky
<|endoftext|>

if he is nigh
howe'er i die
't will be the dawn of heavenly ecstasy
<|endoftext|>

beholding thee
what bliss 't will be
with all thy saints to spend eternity
<|endoftext|>

from sorrow sin and frailty free
beholding and resembling thee
o too transporting sight
<|endoftext|>

haste
haste
my lord and soon transport me there
<|endoftext|>

such a joy as none can move
such a love as none can part
such a heart as joys in love
<|endoftext|>

unfading hope
when life's last embers burn
when soul to soul and dust to dust return
<|endoftext|>

will the past then come again
rest and pleasure strife and pain

he cried aloud and listened and then knocked
and uttered awful threatenings and complaints
and imprecations upon men and saints
<|endoftext|>

half choked with rage king robert fiercely said
open: 'tis i the king
art thou afraid
<|endoftext|>

to which king robert answered with a sneer
i am the king and come to claim my own
from an impostor who usurps my throne
<|endoftext|>

but the straw rustled as he turned his head
there were the cap and bells beside his bed
around him rose the bare discolored walls
<|endoftext|>

close by the steeds were champing in their stalls
and in the corner a revolting shape
shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape
<|endoftext|>

do you not know me
does no voice within
answer my cry and say we are akin
<|endoftext|>

gazed at the angel's countenance serene
the emperor laughing said it is strange sport
to keep a madman for thy fool at court
<|endoftext|>

and through the chant a second melody
rose like the throbbing of a single string
i am an angel and thou art the king
<|endoftext|>

king robert who was standing near the throne
lifted his eyes and lo
he was alone
<|endoftext|>

arise he said my angels
a wail of woe and sin
steals through the gates of heaven and saddens all within
<|endoftext|>

and lo
that tear of pity quenched the flame whereon it fell
and with the sunshine of that smile hope entered into hell
<|endoftext|>

welcome my angels
ye have brought a holier joy to heaven
henceforth its sweetest song shall be the song of sin forgiven
<|endoftext|>

if i enter heaven i may not pass
to where they be
though the wail of their bitter pain alas
<|endoftext|>

and the white-robed saints with their crowns and palms
are good to see
and oh so grand are the sounding psalms
<|endoftext|>

and bear its shame
and clasp to his heart for love of me
my guilt and blame
<|endoftext|>

three angels bear the holy grail
with folded feet in stoles of white
on sleeping wings they sail
<|endoftext|>

my spirit beats her mortal bars
as down dark tides the glory slides
and star-like mingles with the stars
<|endoftext|>

then move the trees the copses nod
wings flutter voices hover clear
o just and faithful knight of god
<|endoftext|>

o germ
o fount
o word of love
<|endoftext|>

och
you and only you

<|endoftext|>

now whispers relief to the bosom of pain
and the hair that was shining with diamond and pearl
is wet with the tears of the penitent girl
<|endoftext|>

and is mine one
said abou
nay not so
<|endoftext|>

and when refreshed the soul once more puts on new life and power
oh let thine image
lord alone gild the first waking hour
<|endoftext|>

shine out true light
to guide my way amid that deepening gloom
and rise o morning star the first that dayspring to illume
<|endoftext|>

shall these glad things arise
to verify thy word
and bless our wandering eyes
<|endoftext|>

when brightly shines the prosperous day
be thoughts of thee a cloudy screen
to temper the deceitful ray
<|endoftext|>

o father
grant thy love divine
to make these mystic temples thine
<|endoftext|>

thou art not he who yesterday
sat here and begged beside the way
for he was blind
<|endoftext|>

their words passed by him like the wind
which raves and howls but cannot shock
the hundred-fathom-rooted rock
<|endoftext|>

not that amassing flowers
youth sighed which rose make ours
which lily leave and then as best recall
<|endoftext|>

not that admiring stars
it yearned nor jove nor mars
mine be some figured flame which blends transcends them all
<|endoftext|>

not for such hopes and fears
annulling youth's brief years
do i remonstrate folly wide the mark
<|endoftext|>

rather i prize the doubt
low kinds exist without
finished and finite clods untroubled by a spark
<|endoftext|>

rejoice we are allied
to that which doth provide
and not partake effect and not receive
<|endoftext|>

a spark disturbs our clod
nearer we hold of god
who gives than of his tribes that take i must believe
<|endoftext|>

then welcome each rebuff
that turns earth's smoothness rough
each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go
<|endoftext|>

what is he but a brute
whose flesh hath soul to suit
whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play
<|endoftext|>

to man propose this test
thy body at its best
how far can that project thy soul on its lone way
<|endoftext|>

as the bird wings and sings
let us cry all good things
are ours nor soul helps flesh more now than flesh helps soul
<|endoftext|>

be there for once and all
severed great minds from small
announced to each his station in the past
<|endoftext|>

what though the earlier grooves
which ran the laughing loves
around thy base no longer pause and press
<|endoftext|>

what though about thy rim
scull-things in order grim
grow out in graver mood obey the sterner stress
<|endoftext|>

religion relates to life and the life of religion is to do
good
swedenborg
<|endoftext|>

have i not lord gone day by day
where thy poor children dwell
and carried help and gold and food
<|endoftext|>

have i not watched and wept
she cried
did thy dear saints do more
<|endoftext|>

consume and cleanse the sin
that lingers still within its depths
let heavenly love begin
<|endoftext|>

so we inherit that sweet purity
for which we struggled failed and agonized
with widening retrospect that bred despair
<|endoftext|>

this is life to come
which martyred men have made more glorious
for us who strive to follow

an infant crying in the night
an infant crying for the light
and with no language but a cry
<|endoftext|>

dost thou not see the snowy mountain copes
and the green woods beneath them on the slopes
<|endoftext|>

i did and going did a rainbow note
surely thought i
this is the lace of peace's coat
<|endoftext|>

the weary day is at its zenith still
yet 't is as if beside some cool clear rill
through shadowy stillness rose an evening psalm
<|endoftext|>

while inly rose the sense in swelling tide
of weakness insufficiency and sin
and fear and gloom and doubt in mighty flood rolled in
<|endoftext|>

waters flowed over mine head then i said i am cut

<|endoftext|>

god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
not just not god: not feared then nor obeyed
your fear itself of death removes the fear
<|endoftext|>

that ye shall be as gods since i as man
internal man is but proportion meet
i of brute human ye of human gods
<|endoftext|>

so ye shall die perhaps by putting off
human to put on gods death to be wished
though threatened which no worse than this can bring

the world was all before them where to choose
their place of rest and providence their guide

<|endoftext|>

in the world's broad field of battle
in the bivouac of life
be not like dumb driven cattle
<|endoftext|>

i slept and dreamed that life was beauty
i woke and found that life was duty
was then thy dream a shadowy lie
<|endoftext|>

toil on sad heart courageously
and thou shalt find thy dream to be
a noonday light and truth to thee
<|endoftext|>

serene will be our days and bright
and happy will our nature be
when love is an unerring light
<|endoftext|>

i call thee: i myself commend
unto thy guidance from this hour
oh let my weakness have an end
<|endoftext|>

let not soft slumber close my eyes
before i've recollected thrice
the train of action through the day
<|endoftext|>

more pale to see
christ hung upon the cruel tree
and bore his father's wrath for me
<|endoftext|>

beneath a rod
more heavy christ for my sake trod
the wine-press of the wrath of god
<|endoftext|>

not so christ
whose mighty love of me sufficed
for strength salvation eucharist
<|endoftext|>

if i bleed
his feet have bled: yea in my need
his heart once bled for mine indeed
<|endoftext|>

so he was young
who for my sake in silence hung
upon the cross with passion wrung
<|endoftext|>

he was more fair
than men who deigned for me to wear
a visage marred beyond compare
<|endoftext|>

daily bread
all else is his who living dead
for me lacked where to lay his head
<|endoftext|>

it was not so
to him whose cup did overflow
with mine unutterable woe
<|endoftext|>

when christ would sup
he drained the dregs from out my cup
so how should i be lifted up
<|endoftext|>

helpless dust
in thee o lord i put my trust
answer thou for me wise and just
<|endoftext|>

witness my god i did
yet i am run again upon the score
my faults cannot be hid
<|endoftext|>

'twill be but labor lost
my good cannot prevail against mine ill
the business will be crost
<|endoftext|>

and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of
righteousness and of judgment

his huge limbs to the accustomed toil

who is thine enemy

aside as idly as the blast
the light leaf from the tree

death in the breast's consuming fires

forever till thus checked
<|endoftext|>

these are thine enemies thy worst
they chain thee to thy lowly lot
thy labor and thy life accursed

he passed again and lo
the well by summers never dried
had cooled ten thousand parching tongues and saved a life besides
<|endoftext|>

it shone upon a genial mind and lo
its light became
a lamp of life a beacon ray a monitory flame
<|endoftext|>

this would i be and would none other be
but a religious servant of my god
and know there is none other god but he
<|endoftext|>

and willingly to suffer mercy's rod
joy in his grace and live but in his love
and seek my bliss but in the world above
<|endoftext|>

and i would frame a kind of faithful prayer
for all estates within the state of grace
that careful love might never know despair
<|endoftext|>

nor servile fear might faithful love deface
and this would i both day and night devise
to make my humble spirit's exercise

only hate from men
only remorse to whisper
of a life that might have been

held in the mouth that languid fever burns
his tasteless food he indolently turns
on alba's oldest stock his soul shall pine
<|endoftext|>

or darkly shadowed forth in dream confused
while the damp brow betrays the inward storm
before him flits thy aggravated form
<|endoftext|>

when muttered thunders shake the lurid sky
whose deadly paleness now the gloom conceals
and now the vivid flash anew reveals
<|endoftext|>

they deem without an aim no thunders rolled
where'er the lightning strikes the flash is thought
judicial fire with heaven's high vengeance fraught

the queen looked up and said
o maiden if indeed you list to sing

<|endoftext|>

let there be naught unfinished broken marred
complete thy purpose that we may become
thy perfect image thou our god and lord
<|endoftext|>

that i may feel thee near
as one who for his weapon feels
in some nocturnal fear

i bless thee

restore that lost and loved one to her tower

look they not ever brightest when they fly

whenever the sun shines brightly
i rise and say
surely it is the shining of his face
<|endoftext|>

i saw a vision in my sleep
that gave my spirit strength to sweep
adown the gulf of time
<|endoftext|>

i saw the last of human mould
that shall creation's death behold
as adam saw her prime
<|endoftext|>

the sun's eye had a sickly glare
the skeletons of nations were
around that lonely man
<|endoftext|>

some had expired in fight the brands
still rusted in their bony hands
in plague and famine some
<|endoftext|>

earth's cities had no sound nor tread
and ships were drifting with the dead
to shores where all was dumb
<|endoftext|>

my lips that speak thy dirge of death
their rounded gasp and gurgling breath
to see thou shalt not boast
<|endoftext|>

the eclipse of nature spreads my pall
the majesty of darkness shall
receive my parting ghost

now
he replied only waiting

blessed are they who are homesick for they shall come at
last to their father's house
heinrich stilling

nay if we love and honor we shall make
the absence brief by doing well our task
not for ourselves but for the dear one's sake
<|endoftext|>

and at his coming only of him ask
approval of the work which most was done
not for ourselves but our beloved one
<|endoftext|>

and far beyond the light of sun or star
four little ones of mine through that fair land
are walking hand in hand
<|endoftext|>

stay then till sorrow dies
then hope and happy skies
are thine forever
<|endoftext|>

me for celestial homes of glory born
why here o why so long
do ye behold an exile from on high
<|endoftext|>

hark
they whisper angels say
sister spirit come away
<|endoftext|>

see where mid work of his own hand he lies
fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses
with light upon him from his father's eyes
<|endoftext|>

yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might
i only have relinquished one delight
to live beneath your more habitual sway
<|endoftext|>

'tis the divinity that stirs within us
'tis heaven itself that points out a hereafter
and intimates eternity to man

so spake the wise old warrior
and all about him cried
paulinus' god hath conquered
<|endoftext|>

who leads us with a gentle hand
thither oh thither
into the silent land
<|endoftext|>

who in life's battle firm doth stand
shall bear hope's tender blossoms
into the silent land
<|endoftext|>

let death between us be as naught
a dried and vanished stream
your joy be the reality
<|endoftext|>

but lying darkly between
winding down through the night
is the silent unknown stream
<|endoftext|>

that heart whose fondest throbs to me were given
my name on earth was ever in thy prayer
and wilt thou never utter it in heaven
<|endoftext|>

the love that lived through all the stormy past
and meekly with my harsher nature bore
and deeper grew and tenderer to the last
<|endoftext|>

yet though thou wear'st the glory of the sky
the same fair thoughtful brow and gentle eye
lovelier in heaven's sweet climate yet the same
<|endoftext|>

the lover there drank her delicious breath
whose love has yielded since to change or death
the mother kissed her child whose days are o'er
<|endoftext|>

they whom we loved and lost so long ago
dwell in those cities far from mortal woe
haunt those fresh woodlands whence sweet carollings soar
<|endoftext|>

who would not go
with buoyant steps to gain that blessed portal
which opens to the land we long to know
<|endoftext|>

where shall be satisfied the soul's immortal
where we shall drop the wearying and the woe
in resting so
<|endoftext|>

fairer than all our spirit's fairest dreaming
eye hath not seen no heart can understand
the things prepared the cloudless radiance streaming
<|endoftext|>

with this minute distinction emblems just
nature revolves but man advances both
eternal that a circle this a line
<|endoftext|>

wide yawns the gap connection is no more
checked reason halts her next step wants support
striving to climb she tumbles from her scheme
<|endoftext|>

festus
i would it were
this life's a mystery
<|endoftext|>

we should count time by heart-throbs
he most lives
who thinks most feels the noblest acts the best
<|endoftext|>

that round my pathway roar
do ye not know some spot
where mortals weep no more
<|endoftext|>

my soul there is a country
afar beyond the stars
all skilful in the wars
<|endoftext|>

mine eyes their vigils keep
for very love beholding
thy happy name they weep
<|endoftext|>

o paradise of joy
where tears are ever banished
and smiles have no alloy
<|endoftext|>

o lovelier far than gold
with laurel-girt battalions
and safe victorious fold
<|endoftext|>

the lord shall be thy part
his only his forever
thou shalt be and thou art
<|endoftext|>

there lust and lucre cannot dwell
there envy bears no sway
there is no hunger thirst nor heat
<|endoftext|>

oh
that my sorrows had an end
thy joys that i might see
<|endoftext|>

o god
that i jerusalem
with speed may go behold
<|endoftext|>

for why
the pleasures there abound
which here cannot be told
<|endoftext|>

our pleasures are but pain
our joys not worth the looking on
our sorrows aye remain
<|endoftext|>

thy joys when shall i see
the king sitting upon his throne
and thy felicity
<|endoftext|>

fetch me thy fold unto
that all thy angels may rejoice
while all thy will i do
<|endoftext|>

through me you pass into the city of woe
through me you pass into eternal pain
through me among the people lost for aye
<|endoftext|>

justice the founder of my fabric moved
to rear me was the task of power divine
supremest wisdom and primeval love
<|endoftext|>

besides when i this point concluded thus
by praying no defect could be supplied
because the prayer had none access to god
<|endoftext|>

'gainst the old adversary prove thou not
our virtue easily subdued but free
from his incitements and defeat his wiles
<|endoftext|>

so day was sinking when the angel of god
appeared before us
joy was in his mien
<|endoftext|>

remember thee remember thee if i
safe e'en on geryon brought thee now i come
more near to god wilt thou not trust me now
<|endoftext|>

into the fire before me then he walked
and statius who erewhile no little space
had parted us he prayed to come behind
<|endoftext|>

what i have heard
is plain thou say'st: but wherefore god this way
for our redemption chose eludes my search
<|endoftext|>

fix now thine eye intently as thou canst
on the everlasting counsel and explore
instructed by my words the dread abyss
<|endoftext|>

and for his justice every method else
were all too scant had not the son of god
humbled himself to put on mortal flesh
<|endoftext|>

with all the heart and with that tongue which speaks
the same in all an holocaust i made
to god befitting the new grace vouchsafed
<|endoftext|>

here memory mocks the toil of genius
christ
beamed on that cross and pattern fails me now

[sections and of queen mab rehandled and published by shelley
in the alastor volume  see bibliographical list and the
editor's introductory note to queen mab
<|endoftext|>

he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception
blasted by his
disappointment he descends to an untimely grave
<|endoftext|>

'the good die first
and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust
burn to the socket
<|endoftext|>

there was a youth who as with toil and travel
had grown quite weak and gray before his time
nor any could the restless griefs unravel
<|endoftext|>

for nought of ill his heart could understand
but pity and wild sorrow for the same
not his the thirst for glory or command
<|endoftext|>

for none than he a purer heart could have
or that loved good more for itself alone
of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave
<|endoftext|>

he had a gentle yet aspiring mind
just innocent with varied learning fed
and such a glorious consolation find
<|endoftext|>

his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower
is love and justice clothed in which he sate
apart from men as in a lonely tower
<|endoftext|>

those false opinions which the harsh rich use
to blind the world they famish for their pride
nor did he hold from any man his dues
<|endoftext|>

liberal he was of soul and frank of heart
and to his many friends all loved him well
whate'er he knew or felt he would impart
<|endoftext|>

and mortal hate their thousand voices rose
they passed like aimless arrows from his ear
nor did his heart or mind its portal close
<|endoftext|>

through which his soul like vesper's serene beam
piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds
shone softly burning though his lips did seem
<|endoftext|>

were driven within him by some secret power
which bade them blaze and live and roll afar
like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower
<|endoftext|>

a mirror found he knew not none could know
but on whoe'er might question him he turned
the light of his frank eyes as if to show
<|endoftext|>

the cause of his disquietude or shook
with spasms of silent passion or turned pale
so that his friends soon rarely undertook
<|endoftext|>

that memories of an antenatal life
made this where now he dwelt a penal hell
and others said that such mysterious grief
<|endoftext|>

by mortal fear or supernatural awe
and others ''tis the shadow of a dream
which the veiled eye of memory never saw
<|endoftext|>

men held with one another nor did he
like one who labours with a human woe
decline this talk: as if its theme might be
<|endoftext|>

with soul-sustaining songs and sweet debates
of ancient lore there fed his lonely being
'the mind becomes that which it contemplates
<|endoftext|>

and blighting hope who with the news of death
struck body and soul as with a mortal blight
she saw between the chestnuts far beneath
<|endoftext|>

and athanase her child who must have been
then three years old sate opposite and gazed
in patient silence
<|endoftext|>

thus through his age dark cold and tempest-tossed
shone truth upon zonoras and he filled
from fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost
<|endoftext|>

the youth as shadows on a grassy hill
outrun the winds that chase them soon outran
his teacher and did teach with native skill
<|endoftext|>

so in the caverns of the forest green
or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar
zonoras and prince athanase were seen
<|endoftext|>

which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam
whilst all the constellations of the sky
seemed reeling through the storm
<|endoftext|>

'and the far sighings of yon piny dale
made vocal by some wind we feel not here
i bear alone what nothing may avail
<|endoftext|>

loves then the shade of his own soul half seen
in any mirror or the spring's young minions
the winged leaves amid the copses green
<|endoftext|>

'twas at this season that prince athanase
passed the white alps those eagle-baffling mountains
slept in their shrouds of snow beside the ways
<|endoftext|>

catch thee and feed from their o'erflowing bowls
thousands who thirst for thine ambrosial dew
thou art the radiance which where ocean rolls
<|endoftext|>

trembling in drops on the discoloured skin
of those who love their kind and therefore perish
in ghastly torture a sweet medicine
<|endoftext|>

her hair was brown her sphered eyes were brown
and in their dark and liquid moisture swam
like the dim orb of the eclipsed moon

i'll go live under the ivy that overgrows the terrace and count the
tears shed on its old plays the song of

swift as a spirit hastening to his task
of glory and of good the sun sprang forth
rejoicing in his splendour and the mask
<|endoftext|>

isle ocean and all things that in them wear
the form and character of mortal mould
rise as the sun their father rose to bear
<|endoftext|>

had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem
the cone of night now they were laid asleep
stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem
<|endoftext|>

was so transparent that the scene came through
as clear as when a veil of light is drawn
o'er evening hills they glimmer and i knew
<|endoftext|>

as in that trance of wondrous thought i lay
this was the tenour of my waking dream
methought i sate beside a public way
<|endoftext|>

all hastening onward yet none seemed to know
whither he went or whence he came or why
he made one of the multitude and so
<|endoftext|>

and others as with steps towards the tomb
pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath
and others mournfully within the gloom
<|endoftext|>

but more with motions which each other crossed
pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw
or birds within the noonday aether lost
<|endoftext|>

upon that path where flowers never grew
and weary with vain toil and faint for thirst
heard not the fountains whose melodious dew
<|endoftext|>

with overarching elms and caverns cold
and violet banks where sweet dreams brood but they
pursued their serious folly as of old
<|endoftext|>

so came a chariot on the silent storm
of its own rushing splendour and a shape
so sate within as one whom years deform
<|endoftext|>

speed in the van and blindness in the rear
nor then avail the beams that quench the sun
or that with banded eyes could pierce the sphere
<|endoftext|>

the crowd gave way and i arose aghast
or seemed to rise so mighty was the trance
and saw like clouds upon the thunder-blast
<|endoftext|>

by action or by suffering and whose hour
was drained to its last sand in weal or woe
so that the trunk survived both fruit and flower
<|endoftext|>

fled back like eagles to their native noon
or those who put aside the diadem
of earthly thrones or gems
<|endoftext|>

was soothed by mischief since the world begun
throw back their heads and loose their streaming hair
and in their dance round her who dims the sun
<|endoftext|>

kindle invisibly and as they glow
like moths by light attracted and repelled
oft to their bright destruction come and go
<|endoftext|>

yet ere i can say where the chariot hath
passed over them nor other trace i find
but as of foam after the ocean's wrath
<|endoftext|>

and follow in the dance with limbs decayed
seeking to reach the light which leaves them still
farther behind and deeper in the shade
<|endoftext|>

that what i thought was an old root which grew
to strange distortion out of the hill side
was indeed one of those deluded crew
<|endoftext|>

'i will unfold that which to this deep scorn
led me and my companions and relate
the progress of the pageant since the morn
<|endoftext|>

'taught them not this to know themselves their might
could not repress the mystery within
and for the morn of truth they feigned deep night
<|endoftext|>

'without the opportunity which bore
him on its eagle pinions to the peak
from which a thousand climbers have before
<|endoftext|>

that every pigmy kicked it as it lay
and much i grieved to think how power and will
in opposition rule our mortal day
<|endoftext|>

'frederick and paul catherine and leopold
and hoary anarchs demagogues and sage
names which the world thinks always old
<|endoftext|>

'and life where long that flower of heaven grew not
conquered that heart by love which gold or pain
or age or sloth or slavery could subdue not
<|endoftext|>

'the other long outlived both woes and wars
throned in the thoughts of men and still had kept
the jealous key of truth's eternal doors
<|endoftext|>

had founded many a sceptre-bearing line
and spread the plague of gold and blood abroad
and gregory and john and men divine
<|endoftext|>

for the true sun it quenched 'their power was given
but to destroy ' replied the leader: 'i
am one of those who have created even

to this dread pass methinks even thou mayst guess
why this should be my mind can compass not

the stems of the sweet flowers and filled the grove
with sounds which whoso hears must needs forget

at eventide a king would mourn no more

their tread broke not the mirror of its billow
glided along the river and did bend her
<|endoftext|>

'of leaves and winds and waves and birds and bees
and falling drops moved in a measure new
yet sweet as on the summer evening breeze
<|endoftext|>

'and still her feet no less than the sweet tune
to which they moved seemed as they moved to blot
the thoughts of him who gazed on them and soon

of heaven's living eyes like day she came
making the night a dream and ere she ceased
<|endoftext|>

'into this valley of perpetual dream

pass not away upon the passing stream
<|endoftext|>

'where the first wave had more than half erased
the track of deer on desert labrador
whilst the wolf from which they fled amazed
<|endoftext|>

'and the fair shape waned in the coming light
as veil by veil the silent splendour drops
from lucifer amid the chrysolite
<|endoftext|>

'or the soft note in which his dear lament
the brescian shepherd breathes or the caress
that turned his weary slumber to content
<|endoftext|>

'more dimly than a day-appearing dream
the host of a forgotten form of sleep
a light of heaven whose half-extinguished beam
<|endoftext|>

'the forest and as if from some dread war
triumphantly returning the loud million
fiercely extolled the fortune of her star
<|endoftext|>

'and underneath aethereal glory clad
the wilderness and far before her flew
the tempest of the splendour which forbade
<|endoftext|>

'others stood gazing till within the shade
of the great mountain its light left them dim
others outspeeded it and others made
<|endoftext|>

'the chariot and the captives fettered there
but all like bubbles on an eddying flood
fell into the same track at last and were
<|endoftext|>

'the thickest billows of that living storm
i plunged and bared my bosom to the clime
of that cold light whose airs too soon deform
<|endoftext|>

'of him who from the lowest depths of hell
through every paradise and through all glory
love led serene and who returned to tell
<|endoftext|>

'grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers
the earth was gray with phantoms and the air
was peopled with dim forms as when there hovers
<|endoftext|>

'phantoms diffused around and some did fling
shadows of shadows yet unlike themselves
behind them some like eaglets on the wing
<|endoftext|>

'of kingly mantles some across the tiar
of pontiffs sate like vultures others played
under the crown which girt with empire
<|endoftext|>

'of daemon wings and laughed from their dead eyes
to reassume the delegated power
arrayed in which those worms did monarchize
<|endoftext|>

'of her last cub glared ere it died each one
of that great crowd sent forth incessantly
these shadows numerous as the dead leaves blown
<|endoftext|>

'obscure clouds moulded by the casual air
and of this stuff the car's creative ray
wrought all the busy phantoms that were there
<|endoftext|>

'and fell as i have fallen by the wayside
those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed
and least of strength and beauty did abide
<|endoftext|>

and turned to smite what he no more could see
<|endoftext|>

i could not view his fatness for his soul
which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone
as haps to voyagers of the summer air
<|endoftext|>

lord
sighed his aspect weeping o'er the jest
what simple mouse brought such a mountain forth
<|endoftext|>

beauty she sighs o'er and she sighs o'er gold
gold will buy all things even a sweet husband
else only heaven is left and farewell youth
<|endoftext|>

surely if some young flowers of spring were put
into the tender hollow of her heart
'twould faintly answer trembling in their petals
<|endoftext|>

he moves small fingers much and all his speech
is like a sampler of precisest words
set in the pattern of a simpleton
<|endoftext|>

and when amid startled birds she sings lament
mocking in hope the long voice of the stream
it seems her heart's lute hath a broken string
<|endoftext|>

better be out of sight of peering eyes
out out of hearing of all-useless words
spoken of tedious tongues in heedless ears
<|endoftext|>

and lest at last the world should learn heart-secrets
lest that sweet wolf from some dim thicket steal
better the glassy horror of the stream
<|endoftext|>

darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars
and a far roar of long-drawn cataracts
flooding immeasurable night with sound
<|endoftext|>

the roar of london is the roar of ire
the lion utters in his old desire
for libya out of dim captivity
<|endoftext|>

and the deep wonder of her starry eyes
seemingly lost in cloudless paradise
and all earth's sorrow out of memory gone
<|endoftext|>

no breast wherein
to chase away
that watchful shape
<|endoftext|>

vain vain to say
haunt not with night
the day
<|endoftext|>

a blotted page
from that clear little book life's taken away
how could i read it dear so dark the day
<|endoftext|>

over and over again
martha would tell us her stories
in the hazel glen
<|endoftext|>

like a dream you dream in the night
fairies and gnomes stole out
in the leaf-green light
<|endoftext|>

but when the sweet moon comes
showering her silver down
they droop where they have blown
<|endoftext|>

no voice is audible
the wind
sleeps in its peace
<|endoftext|>

of stars that strangely stir
smitten to fire by the sandals of him
who walks with her
<|endoftext|>

the fire-flames crooned a tiny song
no cold wind moved the wintry tree
beside their mother's knee
<|endoftext|>

and from her leafy night-hung nook
upon this stranger soft did look
the nightingale: sighed he
<|endoftext|>

thus then these two small birds perched there
breathed a strange riddle both did share
yet neither could expound
<|endoftext|>

and we who sing but as we can
in the small knowledge of a man
have we an answer found
<|endoftext|>

so stand i here my woes entreating
in this dark alley lest the moon
point with her sparkling my barbed armoury
<|endoftext|>

step very softly sweet quiet-foot
stumble not whisper not smile not
by this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow
<|endoftext|>

think
in time's smallest clock's minutest beat
might there not rest be found for wandering feet
<|endoftext|>

no no
nor earth nor air nor fire nor deep
could lull poor mortal longingness asleep
<|endoftext|>

thus have they told me
and i come
as flies the wounded wild-bird home
<|endoftext|>

silence
still faint on the porch
brake the flames of the stars
<|endoftext|>

she will not die they say
she will but put her beauty by
and hie away
<|endoftext|>

oh but her beauty gone how lonely
then will seem all reverie
how black to me
<|endoftext|>

all things will sad be made
and every hope a memory
all gladness dead
<|endoftext|>

ghosts of the past will know
my weakest hour and whisper to me
and coldly go
<|endoftext|>

and hers in deep of sleep
clothed in its mortal beauty i shall see
and waking weep
<|endoftext|>

naught will my mind then find
in man's false heaven my peace to be
all blind and blind
<|endoftext|>

and none lifts a hand to withhold
a friend from the touch of that foe
heart cries unto heart thou art old
<|endoftext|>

there now
death goes
mayhap i've wearied him
<|endoftext|>

come love my lad
nodding that drowsy head
'tis time thy prayers were said
<|endoftext|>

even the gods must feel
a smarting of the eyes
as these fumes upsweal
<|endoftext|>

while the shape who hoofs applause
behind our deafened ear
hoots angel-wise the cause
<|endoftext|>

heavenly archer bend thy bow
now the flame of life burns low
youth is gone i too would go
<|endoftext|>

even fortune leads to this
harsh or kind at last she is
murderess of all ecstasies
<|endoftext|>

yet the spirit dark alone
bound in sense still hearkens on
for tidings of a bliss foregone
<|endoftext|>

ah me
what a strange what a gladsome duet
from a house in the deeps of a wood
<|endoftext|>

such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet
a-laughing as loud as they could could could
a-laughing as loud as they could
<|endoftext|>

now only night is where the pedlar was
and bleak as frost upon a quickling bud
his magic steals in darkness o alas
<|endoftext|>

why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled
sad to and fro in green and secret ways
with solemn bells the burden of his days
<|endoftext|>

wh-s-st
said dame hickory ye false faerie
ye cry like a wolf ye do and trouble poor me
<|endoftext|>

the fiends stared down with leaden eye
fanning the chill air duskily
'twixt their hoods they stoop and cry
<|endoftext|>

for every tooth
of his in sooth
a stag in pawn i hold o
<|endoftext|>

what ghostly hound is this that fleet
comes fawning to his mistress' feet
and courses round his master
<|endoftext|>

how swiftly love
may grief remove
how happy make disaster
<|endoftext|>

o
who are ye sweet lucy cries that in a dreadful ring
all muffled up in brindled shawls do caper frisk and spring
<|endoftext|>

withdraw my curtains from the night
upon my eyelids while i sleep
and soothe me with her beams benign

and that shall be to freedom quaffed
while freedom's foes are flying
<|endoftext|>

but redder yet that light shall glow
and bloodier yet the torrent flow
of iser rolling rapidly
<|endoftext|>

the combat deepens
on ye brave
who rush to glory or the grave
<|endoftext|>

wave munich
all thy banners wave
and charge with all thy chivalry
<|endoftext|>

the snow shall be their winding-sheet
and every turf beneath their feet
shall be a soldier's sepulchre
<|endoftext|>

now let there be the merry sound of music and the dance
through thy corn-fields green and sunny vines o pleasant land of
france
<|endoftext|>

hurrah
hurrah
a single field hath turned the chance of war
<|endoftext|>

hurrah
hurrah
for ivry and henry of navarre
<|endoftext|>

a thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest
and in they burst and on they rushed while like a guiding star
amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of navarre
<|endoftext|>

and then we thought on vengeance and all along our van
remember saint bartholomew
was passed from man to man
<|endoftext|>

oh
was there ever such a knight in friendship or in war
as our sovereign lord king henry the soldier of navarre
<|endoftext|>

up with it high unfurl it wide that all the host may know
how god hath humbled the proud house which wrought his church such
woe
<|endoftext|>

ho
philip send for charity thy mexican pistoles
that antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearmen's souls
<|endoftext|>

hard soldier in unending quarrel
who cost so much of insult blood and tears
for only a few boughs of laurel
<|endoftext|>

by thor
who bandy looks with us
must worse than looks endure
<|endoftext|>

who fought and swayed so long
shall soon but live in minstrel words
and owe your names to song
<|endoftext|>

when chief and monarch fall
their names in song shall breathe again
and thrill the feastful hall
<|endoftext|>

and guthrum cried nay bard no more
we hear thy boding lay
make drunk the song with spoil and gore
<|endoftext|>

with all its death before my soul
the vision rises fair
raise loud the song and drain the bowl
<|endoftext|>

next day did many widows come
their husbands to bewail
they washed their wounds in brinish tears
<|endoftext|>

the first word that sir patrick read
the neist word that sir patrick read
the tear blinded his e'e
<|endoftext|>

for he pulled up the bonny brier
and flang 'tin st
mary's loch
<|endoftext|>

though ne'er a buck appear
there's health for horse and gentleman
a-hunting of the deer
<|endoftext|>

fathers that like so many alexanders
have in these parts from morn till even fought
and sheathed their swords for lack of argument
<|endoftext|>

a steed
a steed of matchlesse speed
a sword of metal keene
<|endoftext|>

and hark
like the roar of the billows on the shore
the cry of battle rises along their charging line
<|endoftext|>

down
down
forever down with the mitre and the crown
<|endoftext|>

o'brien's voice is hoarse with joy as halting he commands
fix bayonets charge
like mountain-storm rush on those fiery bands
<|endoftext|>

revenge
remember limerick
dash down the sacsanagh
<|endoftext|>

the english strove with desperate strength paused rallied scattered
fled
the green hillside is matted close with dying and with dead
<|endoftext|>

again
again
again
<|endoftext|>

the sturdy trooper straight repeated
when all the village cheers us on
that you in tears apart are seated
<|endoftext|>

but hush
hark
a deep sound strikes like a rising knell
<|endoftext|>

or whispering with white lips the foe
they come
they come
<|endoftext|>

theirs but to do and die
into the valley of death
rode the six hundred
<|endoftext|>

there was one of us a corporal's wife
a fair young gentle thing
wasted with fever in the siege
<|endoftext|>

and now they played auld lang syne
it came to our men like the voice of god
and they shouted along the line
<|endoftext|>

small was the band that escaped from the slaughter
flying for life as the tide 'gan to flow
hast thou no pity thou dark rolling water
<|endoftext|>

through darksome night till dawn of day
absorbed in wakeful thoughts he lay
of scotland and her crown
<|endoftext|>

wha for scotland's king and law
freedom's sword will strongly draw
freeman stand or freeman fa
<|endoftext|>

by our sons in servile chains
we will drain our dearest veins
but they shall be free
<|endoftext|>

blooming at beltane in winter to fade
when the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain
the more shall clan-alpine exult in her shade
<|endoftext|>

o that some seedling gem
worthy such noble stem
honored and blessed in their shadow might grow
<|endoftext|>

but moray wheeled his rearward flank
of horsemen on clan-alpine's flank
my bannerman advance
<|endoftext|>

now gallants
for your ladies' sake
upon them with the lance
<|endoftext|>

faster and faster
chief vassal page and groom
tenant and master
<|endoftext|>

no longer blount the view could bear
by heaven and all its saints i swear
i will not see it lost
<|endoftext|>

fitz-eustace you with lady clare
may bid your beads and patter prayer
i gallop to the host
<|endoftext|>

the fiery youth with desperate charge
made for a space an opening large
the rescued banner rose
<|endoftext|>

young blount his armor did unlace
and gazing on his ghastly face
said by saint george he's gone
<|endoftext|>

for wasting fire and dying groan
and priests slain on the altar stone
might bribe him for delay
<|endoftext|>

but hear o ye swains 'tis a tale most profane
how all the tyrannical powers
kings commons and lords are united amain
<|endoftext|>

in their ragged regimentals
stood the old continentals
yielding not
<|endoftext|>

and got a mighty name sir
cornwallis jigged with young fayette
but suffered in his fame sir
<|endoftext|>

his music soon forgets to play
his feet can move no more sir
and all his bands now curse the day
<|endoftext|>

come is not this a griper
that while your hopes are danced away
'tis you must pay the piper
<|endoftext|>

hark to the ominous sound
how the far-off gales their battle form
and the great sea-swells feel ground
<|endoftext|>

one hand is fallen in the sea
the gulf stream drifts it far and free
and in that hand her shining brand gleams from the depths resplendently
<|endoftext|>

for panoply and coronal
the mighty immemorial
and everlasting canopy and starry arch and shield of all
<|endoftext|>

the dead line and the pent-up pen
the thousands quartered in the fen
the living-deaths of skin and bone that were the goodly shapes of men
<|endoftext|>

and his great darkness with the pall
of his dread judgment cover all
till the dead nation rise transformed by truth to triumph over all
<|endoftext|>

it's you thet's to decide
ain't your bonds held by fate john
like all the world's beside
<|endoftext|>

ah captain
here goes for a fine-drawn bead
there's music around when my barrel's in tune
<|endoftext|>

crack
went the rifle the messenger sped
and dead from his horse fell the ringing dragoon
<|endoftext|>

strangle the fool that dares to scoff
attention
it's his way
<|endoftext|>

quick step
we're with him before morn
that's stonewall jackson's way
<|endoftext|>

charge stuart
pay off ashby's score
in stonewall jackson's way
<|endoftext|>

ah maiden
wait and watch and yearn
for news of stonewall's band
<|endoftext|>

ah widow
read with eyes that burn
that ring upon thy hand
<|endoftext|>

honor to her
and let a tear
fall for her sake on stonewall's bier
<|endoftext|>

one look to heaven
no thoughts of home
the guidons that we bear are dearer
<|endoftext|>

cling
clang
forward all
<|endoftext|>

breathe a prayer but no sigh think for what you would fight
then charge
with a will boys and god for the right
<|endoftext|>

how he strode his brown steed
how we saw his blade brighten
in the one hand still left and the reins in his teeth
<|endoftext|>

what to him is friend or foeman
rise of moon or set of sun
hand of man or kiss of woman
<|endoftext|>

what cares he
he cannot know
lay him low
<|endoftext|>

at last from out the centre fight
spurred up a general's aide
that battery must silenced be
<|endoftext|>

when midst the storm of shell
our leader with his sword upraised
beneath our bayonets fell
<|endoftext|>

up
up the hill we followed bill
and we captured every gun
<|endoftext|>

by heavens
the foemen may track me in blood
for this hole in my breast is outpouring a flood
<|endoftext|>

no
no surgeon for me he can give me no aid
the surgeon i want is pickaxe and spade
<|endoftext|>

but we stood did we not
like immovable rock
unheeding their balls and repelling their shock
<|endoftext|>

did you mind the loud cry
when as turning to fly
our men sprang upon them determined to die
<|endoftext|>

great heavens
this bullet-hole gapes like a grave
a curse on the aim of the traitorous knave
<|endoftext|>

here morris old fellow get hold of my hand
and wilson my comrade o wasn't it grand
when they came down the hill like a thunder-charged cloud
<|endoftext|>

where's wilson my comrade
here stoop down your head
can't you say a short prayer for the dying and dead
<|endoftext|>

confusion to traitors
keep hold of my hand
and float the old flag o'er a prosperous land
<|endoftext|>

impatient to be where the battle-field calls
every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
with sheridan only ten miles away
<|endoftext|>

what was it a dream
am i all alone
in the dreary night and the drizzling rain
<|endoftext|>

hist
ah it was only the river's moan
they have left me behind with the mangled slain
<|endoftext|>

we met from the battling ranks apart
together our weapons hashed and fell
and mine was sheathed in his quivering heart
<|endoftext|>

my brother
would i had died for thee
this burden is more than my soul can bear
<|endoftext|>

yea it was noblest for him it was best
there to pass over the river and rest
under the shade of the trees
<|endoftext|>

our spirits high with new emprise
ambitious of each exercise
and glowing with a martial thirst
<|endoftext|>

athwart the gloom the lightning flashed
and through the cloud some horsemen dashed
and from the heights the thunder pealed
<|endoftext|>

a khamsin wind that scorched and singed
like that infernal flame that fringed
the british squares at waterloo
<|endoftext|>

virginia cried to tennessee
we two together come what may
shall stand upon these works to-day
<|endoftext|>

the tattered standards of the south
were shrivelled at the cannon's mouth
and all her hopes were desolate
<|endoftext|>

in vain virginia charged and raged
a tigress in her wrath uncaged
till all the hill was red and wet
<|endoftext|>

the brave went down
without disgrace
they leaped to ruin's red embrace
<|endoftext|>

they only heard fame's thunders wake
and saw the dazzling sun-burst break
in smiles on glory's bloody face
<|endoftext|>

they smote and fell who set the bars
against the progress of the stars
and stayed the march of motherland
<|endoftext|>

they smote and stood who held the hope
of nations on that slippery slope
amid the cheers of christendom
<|endoftext|>

god lives
he forged the iron will
that clutched and held that trembling hill
<|endoftext|>

a mighty mother turns in tears
the pages of her battle years
lamenting all her fallen sons
<|endoftext|>

follow me
steady
we'll save the day
<|endoftext|>

this was what he seemed to say
and to the light of his glorious eye
the bold brigades thus made reply
<|endoftext|>

we'll go forward but you must go back
and they moved not an inch in the perilous track
go to the rear and we'll send them to hell
<|endoftext|>

touch it not unfold it never
let it droop there furled forever
for its people's hopes are fled
<|endoftext|>

look within
there's an empty stall
where once stood a charger and that is all
<|endoftext|>

all
o god
it is all i can speak
<|endoftext|>

question me not i am old and weak
his sabre and his saddle hang on the wall
and his horse pined to death i have told you all
<|endoftext|>

a cheer and salute for the admiral and here's to the captain bold
and never forget the commodore's debt when the deeds of might are
told
<|endoftext|>

now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
our dreadful marches to delightful measures
<|endoftext|>

o son of peace
the giant cried thy fate
is sealed at last and love shall yield to hate
<|endoftext|>

the unarmed buddha looking with no trace
of fear or anger in the monster's face
in pity said poor fiend even thee i love
<|endoftext|>

and the red sparks lit the air
not alone for the blade was the bright steel made
and he fashioned the first ploughshare
<|endoftext|>

our stanch good friend is he
and for the ploughshare and the plough
to him our praise shall be
<|endoftext|>

where may the grave of that good man be
by the side of a spring on the breast of helvellyn
under the twigs of a young birch-tree
<|endoftext|>

but what are the deeds of to-day
in the days of the years we dwell in
that wear our lives away
<|endoftext|>

there are three words to speak
we will it and what is the foeman
but the dream-strong wakened and weak
<|endoftext|>

the lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle
he heeds not he hears not he's free from all pain
he sleeps his last sleep he has fought his last battle
<|endoftext|>

alas
they have perished in far hilly regions
and all save the fame of their triumph is gone
<|endoftext|>

though nations may combat and war's thunders rattle
no more on the steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain
thou sleep'st thy last sleep thou hast fought thy last battle
<|endoftext|>

nay nay my little girl
quoth he
it was a famous victory
<|endoftext|>

watch that they spread where english blood is spilt
lest mixed and sullied with his country's guilt
the soldier's life-stream flow and heaven displease
<|endoftext|>

two swords there are: one naked apt to smite
thy blade of war and battle-storied one
rejoices in the sheath and hides from light
<|endoftext|>

their shivered swords are red with rust
their haughty banner trailed in dust
is now their martial shroud
<|endoftext|>

ah
what a sound will rise how wild and dreary
when the death-angel touches those swift keys
<|endoftext|>

the soldiers' guard was brief
whilst right is right and wrong is wrong
ye may not seek relief
<|endoftext|>

there is no holier spot of ground
than where defeated valor lies
by mourning beauty crowned
<|endoftext|>

waiting the judgment-day
wet with the rain the blue
wet with the rain the gray

mother says i is that a pie
in tones akin to scorning
it is my son quoth she and one full ripe for christmas morning
<|endoftext|>

but in the parlor
oh the gems on tables walls and floor
rare first editions etchings and old crockery galore
<|endoftext|>

the landlord allowed he was proud
to do the fair thing by that talented crowd
on the rhine generous rhine
<|endoftext|>

so a thimble filled he as full as could be
drink long and drink hearty my jolly friends three
of my wine filling wine
<|endoftext|>

and when ah when the bonds fall due how passing wroth will wax the
state
from nebo's mount to nazareth will spread the cry repudiate
<|endoftext|>

thought the youth and spread his snare
eros chuckling at the blunder
gayly scampered here and there
<|endoftext|>

i was young i did not know
whom it was that venus led
that was many years ago
<|endoftext|>

o heart of mine
lift up thine eyes
and see who in yon manger lies
<|endoftext|>

and the next cavalier sung with make-believe tears
i've loved you
i've loved you these many long years
<|endoftext|>

i have looked for the king this many a day
but the years that mock me will not say
why tarrieth he
<|endoftext|>

oh is it the king come back to me
proudly and fiercely rideth he
with centuries dight
<|endoftext|>

why they gave him turbans red
to adorn his hairless head
and knitted jaunty nightcaps to protect him when abed
<|endoftext|>

in vain the rest demurred
not a single chiding word
those ladies deigned to tolerate remonstrance was absurd
<|endoftext|>

then the other members said
gott im himmel
what a head
<|endoftext|>

and this wonderment increased
till the sympathetic priest
inquired of those same ladies: why this fuss about deceased
<|endoftext|>

whereupon were they appalled
for as one those women squalled
we doted on deceased for being bald bald bald
<|endoftext|>

these and ten thousand other spectres harrow and condemn
the man who's blown in twenty by nine o'clock a
m
<|endoftext|>

they were the boys and they the girls who shared my youthful play
they do not answer to my call
my playmates where are they
<|endoftext|>

o cottage 'neath the maples have you seen those girls and boys
that but a little while ago made oh
such pleasant noise
<|endoftext|>

there's store of wealth
and more of health
in every glass we think
<|endoftext|>

and from the bowl
no genial soul
in such an hour can shrink
<|endoftext|>

and from the bowl
no genial soul
in such an hour will shrink
<|endoftext|>

there's fellowship
in every sip
of friendship's brew we think
<|endoftext|>

and when they saw that cunning little mite
they cried in a chorus expressive of delight
what a cute little boy
<|endoftext|>

why a cute little boy
a funny little boy
a dear little bow-leg boy
<|endoftext|>

now some might suppose that that beautiful bird
performed for her babies the music they heard
for the folk in the little straw parlor don't you
<|endoftext|>

she thought silly girl
't was a beau come to woo
but i guess it was only the cricket don't you
<|endoftext|>

't is there to find the loveliest plates
at such surprisingly low rates
you'd not believe it true
<|endoftext|>

and there is one napoleon vase
i'm sure you'd like to know that place
but no i will not tell
<|endoftext|>

thy breath that was fragrant anon with rapture of music and loving
it grieveth all things with its sting and the frost of its wailing
displeasure
<|endoftext|>

with togas battle axes shields we made a dazzling show
when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st
jo
<|endoftext|>

for love of art not lust for gold consumed us years ago
when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st
jo
<|endoftext|>

my lips were sealed but that it seems quite proper you should know
that rome was nowhere in it at philippi in st
jo
<|endoftext|>

and after all my suffering it were not hard to show
that i got my allopathic dose with brutus at st
jo
<|endoftext|>

oh yes i travelled far and fast that night and i can show
the scars of honest wounds i got with brutus in st
jo
<|endoftext|>

by which you see that public taste has fallen mighty low
since we fought as roman soldiers with brutus in st
jo
<|endoftext|>

he was not dead
i found him there
the pan that i was after
<|endoftext|>

it is to hear his voices
in every note and every line
wherein the heart rejoices
<|endoftext|>

the wolf was very loath to stay
but oh
he could not get away
<|endoftext|>

darned if we know but all the same
happy as larks are we
and happier still we're going to be
<|endoftext|>

said lyman
and frederick
and jim
<|endoftext|>

so it was peter
all day calling reminding and chiding
peter neglected his work therefore that nagging at peter
<|endoftext|>

nor is it stated or guessed what was the trend of those volumes
what thing soever it was done with a pen and a pencil
wrought with a brain not a hoe surely 't was hostile to farming
<|endoftext|>

fudge on all readin
they quoth or that's what's the ruin of
peter
<|endoftext|>

peter derided these things held in such faith by the farmer
scouted at magic and charms hooted at jonahs and hoodoos
thinking and reading of books must have unsettled his reason
<|endoftext|>

surely enough he went out into the damp of the morning
into the smudge that the witch spread over woodland and meadow
into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley
<|endoftext|>

laughing and scoffing he strode into that hideous vapor
just as he said he would do just as he bantered and threatened
ere they could fasten the door peter had done gone and done it
<|endoftext|>

wasting his time over books you see had unsettled his reason
soddened his callow young brain with semi-pubescent paresis
and his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition
<|endoftext|>

this is the legend of old told in the tum-titty meter
which the great poets prefer being less labor than rhyming
nor have i further to say for the sad story is ended
<|endoftext|>

of deep humiliation for the sullen hired-girl
of grief for mother hating to see things wasted so
and of fortune for that little boy who pined to taste that dough
<|endoftext|>

it looked so sweet and yellow sure to taste it were no sin
but oh
how sister scolded if he stuck his finger in
<|endoftext|>

but oh
how should i hail the death
that brings that vinous grace to me
<|endoftext|>

but pretty girls and nice young men
observe a proper silence when
i chose to sing my lyrics to 'em
<|endoftext|>

this man loves farming that man law
while this one follows pathways martial
what moots it whither mortals turn
<|endoftext|>

so now good-by
to drugs say i
good-by thou phantom sorrow
<|endoftext|>

so speak the three as there they lay
when lo
the white stag sped that way
<|endoftext|>

on either margin our songs all done
we move apart while she singeth ever
taking the course of the stooping sun
<|endoftext|>

false false a random charge a blame undue
wrest not fair reasoning to a crooked end
false false as you are true
<|endoftext|>

be pale afar since still to me you shine
and must while nature's eldest law shall hold
ah there's the thought which makes his random line
<|endoftext|>

take courage quoth he and respect the mind
your maker gave for good your fate fulfil
the fate round many hearts your own to wind
<|endoftext|>

false path
it cost me priceless years of life
my well-beloved friend
<|endoftext|>

o shame
they said such music is not meet
go up like ganymede
<|endoftext|>

alas
though ne'er for me those eagle wings
stooped from their eyry proud
<|endoftext|>

but strain to reach it ay with wrestlings stout
and hopes that even in the dark will grow
and ploddings wary and slow
<|endoftext|>

and can i see this light
it may be so
but see it thus and thus my fathers said
<|endoftext|>

if god indeed kept secret couldst thou know
or follow up the mighty artisan
unless he willed it so
<|endoftext|>

that which i know and that which i divine
alas
have left thee out
<|endoftext|>

i have aspired to know the might of god
as if the story of his love was furled
nor sacred foot the grasses e'er had trod
<|endoftext|>

o man with eyes majestic after death
whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough
whose lips drawn human breath
<|endoftext|>

when i looked i dared not sigh: in the light of god's splendor
with his daily blue and gold who am i
what am i
<|endoftext|>

on that sultry august eve trouble had made me meek
i was tired of my sorrow o so faint for it was double
in the weight of its oppression that i could not speak
<|endoftext|>

with that he spread his white wings and swept across the water
lit upon the hooded head and it and all went down
and they laughed as they went under and i woke the old man's daughter
<|endoftext|>

o to be at least a cloud that near thee i might flow
solemnly approach the mountain weep away my being o'er thee
and veil thy breast with icicles and thy brow with snow
<|endoftext|>

m
i'm hearty lass but warm the weather's warm
i think 'tis mostly warm on market days
<|endoftext|>

m
all but this pat that i put by for george
he always loved my butter
<|endoftext|>

c
but i want one to play with o i want
a little yellow duck to take to bed
<|endoftext|>

f
now granny if you'll hold the babe awhile
'tis time i took up willie to his crib
<|endoftext|>

george
well mother 'tis a fortnight now or more
since i set eyes on you
<|endoftext|>

g
were not proud of them
eh mother
<|endoftext|>

m
i set store by mine 'tis true
but then i had good cause
<|endoftext|>

f
no he got his voice from you
do use it george and send the child to sleep
<|endoftext|>

g
ay of the purple grapes and crimson leaves
but mother put your shawl and bonnet off
<|endoftext|>

and frances lass i brought some cresses in
just wash them toast the bacon break some eggs
and let's to supper shortly
<|endoftext|>

oft have i wooed sweet lettice white
by daylight and by candlelight
when we two were apart
<|endoftext|>

some better day come on apace
and let me tell her face to face
maiden thou hast my heart
<|endoftext|>

how gently rock yon poplars high
against the reach of primrose sky
with heaven's pale candles stored
<|endoftext|>

she sees them all sweet lettice white
i'll e'en go sit again to-night
beside her ironing-board
<|endoftext|>

turn back the cradle-quilt and lay him in
and mother will you please to draw your chair
the supper's ready
<|endoftext|>

yet had i but the past she cries
and it was lost i would arise
and comfort me some other wise
<|endoftext|>

we had a message long ago
that like a river peace should flow
and eden bloom again below
<|endoftext|>

that was the last hill of the chain
and fair below i saw the plain
that seemed cold cheer to reprimand
<|endoftext|>

half-drowned in sleepy peace it lay
as satiate with the boundless play
of sunshine in its green array
<|endoftext|>

i looked my thought would make its way
fair is your child of face and limb
the round blue eyes full sweetly shine
<|endoftext|>

a twelvemonths' child was at her side
'whose infant may that be
' i cried
<|endoftext|>

she rose amazed but cursed me too
she could not hold such luck for true
but gave him soon with small ado
<|endoftext|>

master good e'en to ye
a woodman said
who the low hedge was trimming with his shears
<|endoftext|>

in sooth a lyre
and as the soft air played
those branches stirred but did not disunite
<|endoftext|>

light it old sun wet it thou common dew
that 'neath men's feet its image still may be
while yet it waves above them living lyre like thee
<|endoftext|>

only a passing mist the heaven o'ershrouds
it breaks it parts it drifts like scattered spars
what lies behind it but the nightly stars
<|endoftext|>

gone
said the poet and about to be
forgotten: o how sad a fate is hers
<|endoftext|>

ah
turret clock  i would thy hand
were hid behind yon towering maple-trees
<|endoftext|>

and had he friends
one friend perhaps said he
but for the rest i pray you let it be
<|endoftext|>

i will not speak i will not speak to thee
my star
and soon to be my lost lost star
<|endoftext|>

but shortly as there comes to most of us
there came to him the need to quit his home
to tell you why were simply hazardous
<|endoftext|>

peace peace
he cried i lost thee but in truth
there are worse losses than the loss of youth
<|endoftext|>

adieu
the poet said my vanished star
thy duty and thy happiness were one
<|endoftext|>

although he was her friend: but still that day
where elm and hornbeam spread a towering dome
she crossed the dells to her ancestral home
<|endoftext|>

love cannot cool the burning austral sand
nor show the secret waters that lie hid
in arid valleys of that desert land
<|endoftext|>

silent they rest in solemn salvatory
sealed from the moth and the owl and the flitter-mouse
each with his name on his brow
<|endoftext|>

'all the kings of the nations lie in glory
every one in his own house
then why not thou
<|endoftext|>

that i bring thee guard it long
hide the light from buried eyes
hide it lest the dead arise
<|endoftext|>

no more need
o mad mistake
with repentance in its wake
<|endoftext|>

what change has made the pastures sweet
and reached the daisies at my feet
and cloud that wears a golden hem
<|endoftext|>

this lovely world the hills the sward
they all look fresh as if our lord
but yesterday had finished them
<|endoftext|>

and here's the field with light aglow
how fresh its boundary lime-trees show
and how its wet leaves trembling shine
<|endoftext|>

between their trunks come through to me
the morning sparkles of the sea
below the level browsing line
<|endoftext|>

i see the pool more clear by half
than pools where other waters laugh
up at the breasts of coot and rail
<|endoftext|>

there as she passed it on her way
i saw reflected yesterday
a maiden with a milking-pail
<|endoftext|>

but high she held her comely head
i cannot heed it now she said
for carrying of the milking-pail
<|endoftext|>

from the clear pool her face had fled
it rested on my heart instead
reflected when the maid was gone
<|endoftext|>

with happy youth and work content
so sweet and stately on she went
right careless of the untold tale
<|endoftext|>

each step she took i loved her more
and followed to her dairy door
the maiden with the milking-pail
<|endoftext|>

fair shine the blue that o'er her spreads
green be the pastures where she treads
the maiden with the milking-pail
<|endoftext|>

she had not feared as i divine
because she had not hoped
alas
<|endoftext|>

the sorrow of it
for that sign
came but to pass
<|endoftext|>

red rocks that under waters show
blue reaches and a sailing skiff
were spread below
<|endoftext|>

ah
why to that which needs it not
methought should costly things be given
<|endoftext|>

sure home is best
' the son replied
'i have no home
<|endoftext|>

'the perfect face and shed on it
a charm half feeling half surprise
and brim with dreams the exquisite
<|endoftext|>

and o for once let me complain
i must forego life's better part
man's dearer gain
<|endoftext|>

'robbed robbed of life's illusions sweet
and passion fainting at her feet
to wake no more
<|endoftext|>

i would for all my fealty
that i could be as much to you
as you to me
<|endoftext|>

how he had said that he would fain
that life would at a stand remain
eternally
<|endoftext|>

the well-contented heart be fed
ever as then and all the world
when sails were furled
<|endoftext|>

then closer at her side reclined
the bold brown woman from afar
comes to me blind
<|endoftext|>

it swept with thunderous noises loud
shaped like a curling snow-white cloud
or like a demon in a shroud
<|endoftext|>

then bankes came downe with ruin and rout
then beaten foam flew round about
then all the mighty floods were out
<|endoftext|>

thy pretty bairns in fast embrace
the lifted sun shone on thy face
downe drifted to thy dwelling-place
<|endoftext|>

lift
o lift thou lowering sky
an thou wilt thy gloom forego
<|endoftext|>

lift
o lift thou lowering sky
an thou canst thy blue regain
<|endoftext|>

m
no: e'en my solitude is not mine now
and if i be alone is ofttimes doubt
<|endoftext|>

man dwells apart though not alone
he walks among his peers unread
the best of thoughts which he hath known
<|endoftext|>

i wait for my story the birds cannot sing it
not one as he sits on the tree
the bells cannot ring it but long years o bring it
<|endoftext|>

let the star-clusters glow
let the sweet waters flow
and cross quickly to me
<|endoftext|>

ah my sailor make haste
for the time runs to waste
and my love lieth deep
<|endoftext|>

heigh ho
daisies and buttercups
fair yellow daffodils stately and tall
<|endoftext|>

o that an echo might wake
and waft one note of thy psalm to me
ere my heart-strings break
<|endoftext|>

while swam the unshed tear
her prattlers little heeding
would murmur this bird with its carol clear
<|endoftext|>

when the red clay was kneaden
and god made adam our father dear
sang to him thus in eden
<|endoftext|>

ah
surely methought by these shouts upraised
some travellers are benighted
<|endoftext|>

let the child from its rest be taken
for the captain doth weary for babe and for bride
waken madam waken
<|endoftext|>

the daffodils were fair to see
they nodded lightly on the lea
persephone persephone
<|endoftext|>

drawn nigh she deemed it fairer still
and stooped to gather by the rill
the daffodil the daffodil
<|endoftext|>

o light light light
she cries farewell
the coal-black horses wait for me
<|endoftext|>

demeter seeks her far and wide
and gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam
from many a morn till eventide
<|endoftext|>

or seated on the elysian hill
she dreams of earthly daylight still
and murmurs of the daffodil
<|endoftext|>

the tender corn upon the lea
droops in her goddess gloom when she
cries for her lost persephone
<|endoftext|>

arise and set the maiden free
why should the world such sorrow dree
by reason of persephone
<|endoftext|>

the gates of hades set her free
she will return full soon saith he
my wife my wife persephone
<|endoftext|>

her lips reply without her will
as one addressed who slumbereth still
the daffodil the daffodil
<|endoftext|>

calm queen of hades art thou she
who stepped so lightly on the lea
persephone persephone
<|endoftext|>

come over come home
through the salt sea foam
my sailor my sailor boy
<|endoftext|>

yet come to me home
through the salt sea foam
for the greek must ask elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

many lands they look to me
one of these might be wanting a prince as well
but that's as hereafter may be
<|endoftext|>

she raised her white head
and laughed and she said
that's as hereafter may be
<|endoftext|>

ay ay sir
quoth the fisherman
have done
<|endoftext|>

he cried and then i rolled the rubbish out
more loudly than the meaning warranted
to air my lungs i thought not on the words
<|endoftext|>

then said the fisherman who missed the point
so mike rolls out the psalm you'll hear him sir
please god you live till sunday
<|endoftext|>

even so
and you too fisherman for here they say
you are all church-goers
<|endoftext|>

ay sir and when he was a younger man
he went out in the lifeboat very oft
before the 'grace of sunderland' was wrecked
<|endoftext|>

we too rose up (the crimson in the sky
flushing our faces) and went sauntering on
and thought to reach our lodging by the cliff
<|endoftext|>

and rent with many a crevice where the wind
had laid up drifts of empty eggshells swept
from the bare berths of gulls and guillemots
<|endoftext|>

i charge you mothers
by the mother's milk
he drew and by his father god over all
<|endoftext|>

see here
it is the night
it is the night
<|endoftext|>

i think not fishermen i have not heard
such women curse
god's curse is curse enough
<|endoftext|>

it is enough can such an one be here
yea here
o god forgive you fishermen
<|endoftext|>

a little while it is a little while
a little while and i will comfort thee
i go away but i will come again
<|endoftext|>

god save me i have been a sinful man
and save the lives of them that still can work
for they are good to me ay good to me
<|endoftext|>

but she if any neighbors had come in
: if any neighbors had come in
they might have seen her crying on her knees
<|endoftext|>

and sobbing 'lost lost lost
' beating her breast
her breast forever pricked with cruel thorns
<|endoftext|>

and her tears flow down
down to her lips her lips that kiss the print
of nails and love is like to break her heart
<|endoftext|>

love and repentance for it still doth work
sore in her soul to think to think that she
even she did pierce the sacred sacred feet
<|endoftext|>

and out in darkness with the fisherfolk
we passed and stumbled over mounds of moss
and heard but did not see the passing beck
<|endoftext|>

a simple custom this i love it well
a carved betrothal and a pledge of truth
beneath the yew-trees sat our village youth
<|endoftext|>

ah sweetest voice
how pensive were its tones
and how regretful its unconscious pause
<|endoftext|>

ah would it might be so
i thought and stood
listening entranced among the underwood
<|endoftext|>

my daughter my beloved be not you
like those same roses
o bewildering word
<|endoftext|>

o woman
thou wert fashioned to beguile
so have all sages said all poets sung
<|endoftext|>

she looked again as one that half afraid
would fain be certain of a doubtful thing
or one beseeching do not me upbraid
<|endoftext|>

and then she trembled like the fluttering
of timid little birds and silent stood
no smile wherewith to mock my hardihood
<|endoftext|>

i thought awhile then slumber came to me
and tangled all my fancy in her maze
and i was drifting on a raft at sea
<|endoftext|>

the near all ocean and the far all haze
through the while polished water sharks did glide
and up in heaven i saw no stars to guide
<|endoftext|>

the cleft was wide enough to let me through
i clambered out and felt the balmy breeze
and stepped on churchyard grasses wet with dew
<|endoftext|>

her dreamy smile was very fair to see
and her two hands were folded to her breast
with somewhat held between them heedfully
<|endoftext|>

o fast asleep
and yet methought she knew
and felt my nearness those shut eyelids through
<|endoftext|>

o if this be
i said yet speak to me
i blame my very dream for cruelty
<|endoftext|>

and sayest thou so
she sighed in murmurs sweet
i have nought else to give thee now mine own
<|endoftext|>

when by the churchyard wicket standing still
i cast my eager eyes abroad to know
if change had touched the scenes of long ago
<|endoftext|>

my eyes were dazzled with delightful tears
in sooth they were the last i ever shed
for with them fell the cherished dreams of years
<|endoftext|>

i looked and on the wall above my head
over her seat there was a tablet placed
with one word only on the marble traced
<|endoftext|>

when like shooting-stars the angels
to your couch at nightfall go
are their swift wings heard to rustle
<|endoftext|>

of the valley where it grows
but the baby heart receiveth
more than it bestows
<|endoftext|>

secure from cold hunger and weather stain
fixed in his right and born to good estate
from common ills set by and separate
<|endoftext|>

god
cried the dreaming man right impiously
what have i done that these my sleep affray
<|endoftext|>

god
said the phantom i appeal to thee
appoint thou me this man to be my prey
<|endoftext|>

god
sighed the kneeling woman frail and old
i pray thee take me for the world is cold
<|endoftext|>

her tale
the justice cried
a pauper's tale
<|endoftext|>

and he took heart at this so low behest
and let the stoutness of his will prevail
demanding is't for her you break my rest
<|endoftext|>

speak
though she kneel throughout the livelong night
and yet shall kneel between thee and the light
<|endoftext|>

if thou obey'st a greater tell thy lord
that i have paid her wages
cry to him
<|endoftext|>

he has not much against me
none can say
i have not paid her wages day by day
<|endoftext|>

then
quoth the shade and he constrained said on
then she reproved curtseyed herself away
<|endoftext|>

but yet and yet the dreaded questions came
and didst thou weigh the matter taking thought
upon her sober life and honest fame
<|endoftext|>

i gave it he replied with gaze distraught
i gave it fiend the usual care i took
the usual pains i could not nearer look
<|endoftext|>

she said she was not guilty
ay 'tis true
she said so but the poor are liars all
<|endoftext|>

hear him
the phantom muttered hear this man
o changeless god upon the judgment throne
<|endoftext|>

but what
nay verily nor wealth nor weal
from henceforth shall afford thy soul delight
<|endoftext|>

what thought she on this woman
on her days
of toil or on the supperless night forlorn
<|endoftext|>

with that she opened but for fear she cried
for lo
two angels one on either side
<|endoftext|>

call me o call from this world troublesome
and let me see thy face
he answered come
<|endoftext|>

i said she was a london woman sir
and a fine scholar but i never said
she knew about the songs
<|endoftext|>

ah
there be some hearts i wis
to which nothing comes amiss
<|endoftext|>

'cuckoo cuckoo
float anear in upper blue
art thou yet a prophet true
<|endoftext|>

cry thou black prophetess
sit up awake
forebode and ban them through the desolate night
<|endoftext|>

when i hear the waters fretting
when i see the chestnut letting
all her lovely blossom falter down i think alas the day
<|endoftext|>

once with magical sweet singing
blackbirds set the woodland ringing
that awakes no more while april hours wear themselves away
<|endoftext|>

he knew she did not love him but so long
as rivals were unknown to him he dwelt
at ease and did not find his love a pain
<|endoftext|>

she said
i shall not live to see it but she did
little sickly face a wan thin face
<|endoftext|>

with that they parted from their boy and lived
longing between his holidays and time
sped he grew on till he had eighteen years
<|endoftext|>

i do not care that my one son should sleep
merely for keeping him in breath and wake
only to ride to cover
<|endoftext|>

do laddie
quoth she faltering half in tears
are you not happy with us not content
<|endoftext|>

but his arms
folding he sat and twisted up his mouth
with comical discomfiture
<|endoftext|>

no
do ye laddie
quoth the dame and laughed
<|endoftext|>

what then
he dwelt among them as of old
and taught his mouth to smile
<|endoftext|>

she cared no whit if laurance went or stayed
but answered when he spoke and dropped her cheek
in her fair hand
<|endoftext|>

madam
and muriel lifted up her face
and looked they looked into each other's eyes
<|endoftext|>

all's done
you hear it muriel if you can
o sweet forgive me
<|endoftext|>

but what was that to muriel though her peace
he would have purchased for her with all prayers
and costly passionate despairing tears
<|endoftext|>

ay he was gone
and she whom he had wed
as muriel learned was sick was poor was sad
<|endoftext|>

but when that other heard it is the end
his heart was sick and he as by a power
far stronger than himself was driven to her
<|endoftext|>

reason rebelled against it but his will
required it of him with a craving strong
as life and passionate though hopeless pain
<|endoftext|>

she when she saw his face considered him
full quietly let all excuses pass
not answered and considered yet again
<|endoftext|>

remain
she said for there is something to be told
some words that you must hear
<|endoftext|>

but were it best to weep for a dead wife
and let the sorrow spend and satisfy
itself with all expression and so end
<|endoftext|>

how shall i do the rest
and he who felt
her inmost thought was silent even as she
<|endoftext|>

the wife
considering it with deep and strange delight
forgot for once her babe and looked and learned
<|endoftext|>

mercy
muriel cried
but laurance does not wish it
<|endoftext|>

he knows you love him but he will not speak
no never
some men are such gentlemen
<|endoftext|>

the dropping thorn makes white the grass o sweetest lass and sweetest
lass
come out and smell the ricks of hay adown the croft with me o
<|endoftext|>

and thou my lass by morning's light wast all in white wast all in
white
and parson stood within the rails a-marrying me and thee o
<|endoftext|>

yes and i saw thee start upon thy way
so sure that we should meet
upon our trysting-day
<|endoftext|>

and even absence then to me was sweet
because it brought me time to brood
upon thy dearness in the solitude
<|endoftext|>

i only saw the stars i could not see
the river and they seemed to lie
as far below as the other stars were high
<|endoftext|>

i look on you trembling and think in the dark with my soul
how small is our place 'mid the kingdoms and nations of god
these are greater than we every one
<|endoftext|>

and there falls a great fear and a dread cometh over that cries
o my hope
is there any mistake
<|endoftext|>

did he speak
did i hear
did i listen aright if he spake
<|endoftext|>

did i answer him duly
for surely i now am awake
if never i woke until now
<|endoftext|>

for this is a world full of sorrow
keep watch o'er its dust else thy children for aye are undone
for this is a world where we die
<|endoftext|>

i have felt it
go on while the world is asleep
golden islands fast moored in god's infinite deep
<|endoftext|>

shy she sought the wooer's face and deemed the wooing mended
proper man he was good sooth and one would have his way
so the lass was made a wife and so the song was ended
<|endoftext|>

and dove with the white breast
let me alone the dream is my own
and my heart is full of rest
<|endoftext|>

my love with the true heart
to think i have come to this your home
and yet we are apart
<|endoftext|>

my love
he stood at my right hand
his eyes were grave and sweet
<|endoftext|>

till night rose over the bourne
the dove on the mast as we sailed fast
did mourn and mourn and mourn
<|endoftext|>

and stirred the dens beneath
to see us eat of death
with all the scoffing heavens toward us bending
<|endoftext|>

and the winged armies twain
their awful watch maintain
they mark the earth at rest with her great dead
<|endoftext|>

peace
lo he lifts a priestly hand
and blesseth all the sons of men in every land
<|endoftext|>

silence
o i had my day
margaret margaret
<|endoftext|>

i stoop: within 'tis dark and still
but shadowy paths methinks there be
and lead they far into the hill
<|endoftext|>

through foaming gulfs of yeasty spray
to yield it on a grassy hill
at the noon of day
<|endoftext|>

and behold
there was music within and a song
and echoes did feed on the sweetness repeating it long
<|endoftext|>

i opened the door of my heart
and behold
there was music within and a song
<|endoftext|>

o the song
it came and went
went and came
<|endoftext|>

i have not learned
half the lore whereto it yearned
half the magic that it meant
<|endoftext|>

where's the danger
where's the cold
slippery danger up the steep
<|endoftext|>

chirping bird and tumbling spray
light work laughter scent of hay
peace and echo where are they
<|endoftext|>

o happy gladys
i rejoice with her
for gladys saw the island
<|endoftext|>

but it was said we think it were not well
that little gladys should acquire a taste
for pleasure going about and needless change
<|endoftext|>

and how my heart hushed down and shaded lies
just like the sea when low convenient clouds
come over and drink all its sparkles up
<|endoftext|>

why gladys is a child she has not skill
to shut herself within her own small cell
and build the door up and to say 'poor me
<|endoftext|>

quoth gladys cogitating they were kind
the words that woman spoke
she does not know
<|endoftext|>

why did i envy them
that was not good
yet it began with my humility
<|endoftext|>

child what art doing here
the woman said
what wilt thou of dame isis and her bairn
<|endoftext|>

(ay ay we see thee breathing in thy shroud
pretty shroud all frilled and furbelowed
the air is dim with dust of spiced bones
<|endoftext|>

but o good lord ' saith he 'when these are sick
i fear me lord this excellent workmanship
of thine is counted for a cumbrance then
<|endoftext|>

so gladys set her feet upon the sand
while in the sunset glory died away
the peaks of that blest island
<|endoftext|>

we always read when any fable ends
hence we may learn
a moral must be found
<|endoftext|>

she moves atween the almond boughs and bends
one thick with bloom to look on it
o love
<|endoftext|>

preserve to me my wealth i do not say
for that is wasted away
and much of it was cankered ere it went
<|endoftext|>

no but i pray if it be not too late
open to me the gate
that i may find my babe when i am dead
<|endoftext|>

hangs thick as a swarm of bees
or a clustering village street
foundationless built on the seas
<|endoftext|>

for rain came down in the night
and thunder muttered full oft
but now the azure is bright
<|endoftext|>

many times since we have met
for i hold the years in my heart
and all that was is yet
<|endoftext|>

beautiful eyes and shall i see no more
the living thought when it would leap from them
and play in all its sweetness 'neath their lids
<|endoftext|>

_quoth the cedar to the reeds and rushes
water-grass you know not what i do
know not of my storms nor of my hushes
<|endoftext|>

breathe o wind and set our answer free
for we have no voice of you forsaken
for the cedar-tree
<|endoftext|>

the lovely ladies flocked within
and still would each one say
good mercer be the ships come up
<|endoftext|>

and they flocked to the shore amain
all over the hoe that livelong night
many stood out in the rain
<|endoftext|>

now farther on in womanhood
she gently stands where once she stood
and sings from out her deeper heart
<|endoftext|>

i will not think upon it
yet she was
o she was dear my dutiful dear child
<|endoftext|>

one soweth nay but i will tell this out
the first fyte was the best i call it such
for now as some old song men think on it
<|endoftext|>

i dwell where england narrows running north
and while our hay was cut came rumours up
humming and swarming round our heads like bees
<|endoftext|>

let be ' and pushing past 'beshrew thy heart
bargain
nay
<|endoftext|>

beside them scorched smoke-blackened weary leaned
men that had fed them dropped their tired arms
and dozed
<|endoftext|>

then to our hearts valour crept home again
alva who did convert from our old faith
with many a black deed done for a white cause
<|endoftext|>

o such a sight
o such a sight mine eyes
never shall you see more
<|endoftext|>

all grey the sea and ghostly grey the ships
and after in the offing rocked our fleet
having lain quiet in the summer dark
<|endoftext|>

let spain within a pike's length hear them bleat
delivering of their pretty talk in a tongue
whose meaning cries not for interpreter
<|endoftext|>

and while i spoke their topsails friend and foe
glittered and there was noise of guns pale smoke
lagged after curdling on the sun-fleck'd main
<|endoftext|>

who ever saw weakling white butterflies
chasing of gallant swans and charging them
and spitting at them long red streaks of flame
<|endoftext|>

'two of their caravels we sank and one
took
ere she could catch the wind when she rode free
<|endoftext|>

some did tow
others that we had plagued disabled rent
many full heavily damaged made their berths
<|endoftext|>

blood-red pillars of reek
they looked on that vast host and troubled it
as on th' egyptian host one looked of old
<|endoftext|>

it failed and in regard of that same want
they thought it not convenient to pursue
their vessels farther
<|endoftext|>

all being ready speed i home and lo
my rosamund that by the spaniard sat
upon a cushion'd settle book in hand
<|endoftext|>

she held
her psalter and he his and slowly read
till he would stop her at the needed word
<|endoftext|>

thy wife ' and there he stopped her and he took
and kissed her hand and show'd in 's own a ring
taking no heed of me no heed at all
<|endoftext|>

and slowly slowly she betook herself
down the long hall in lowly wise she went
and made her moans
<|endoftext|>

for i bethought me i was yet an host
and he bethought him on the worthiness
of my first deeds
<|endoftext|>

i will be brief
the days drag on
my soul forebodes her death my lonely age
<|endoftext|>

the pear-trees looked on in their white and blue birds flash'd about
and they too were angry as oliver
were they eleven
<|endoftext|>

a pity
a very great pity
one should be eleven
<|endoftext|>

i knew about heaven
but this was the country of this
light blossom and piping and flashing of wings not at all
<|endoftext|>

'the ways will be long but the days will be long ' quoth the river
'to me a long liver long long
' quoth the river the river
<|endoftext|>

shall i cross by the ferry to-morrow and come in my white
to that little low church
and will oliver meet me anon
<|endoftext|>

schoolmaster

an honest man and ever pays his score
born in the parish old blind as a bat
and strangers sing before him 't is a shame
<|endoftext|>

and i at our trysting stone
whereto i came down alone
was fain o' the wind's wild moan
<|endoftext|>

laurie laurie lad make not wail
with a wiser lass ye'll sure prevail
for ye sing like a woodland nightingale
<|endoftext|>

and there's no sense in it under the sun
for of three that woo i can take but one
so what's to be done what's to be done
<|endoftext|>

there's no sense in it under the sun
and
of three that woo i can take but one
<|endoftext|>

nay but take me home to the churning mill
when cherry boughs white on yon mounting hill
hang over the tufts o' the daffodil
<|endoftext|>

wife
done
nothing love
<|endoftext|>

either the thing has done itself or they
must undo
did they call for fiddler sam
<|endoftext|>

they know the woods their groaning noises weird
they climb in trees that overhang the slow
deep mill-stream loved and feared
<|endoftext|>

behold a ship
her wide yards score the sky
she sails a steel-blue sea
<|endoftext|>

'father dear father bid us now god-speed
we cannot choose but sail it thus befell
'mother dear mother ' 'nay 't is all decreed
<|endoftext|>

so on the mount christ's chosen three
unware that glory it did shroud
feared when they entered into the cloud
<|endoftext|>

how guileless sweet by gift divine
how beautiful dear child was thine
spared all their grief of thee bereaven
<|endoftext|>

winner who had not greatly striven
hurts of sin shall not thee soil
carking care thy beauty spoil
<|endoftext|>

or of the morrow diffident
unconscious beautiful she stood
calm in young stainless maidenhood
<|endoftext|>

the mystery of the world whose name is life
all-conquering wends
and works for aye with rest and cold at strife
<|endoftext|>

yet such for aye divided from us are
as other galaxies that seem no more
than a little golden millet-seed afar
<|endoftext|>

divided swarming down some flat lee shore
then risen while all the air that takes no word
tingles and trembles as with cries not heard
<|endoftext|>

though time be as a moon upon the wane
who walk with faith far up the azure lift
oft hear her talk of lights to wax again
<|endoftext|>

the woman before her lord
shall glory fling
the rolls aside time raze out triumphs past
<|endoftext|>

such as can see
why should they doubt
the childhood of a race
<|endoftext|>

i saw
once in that earth primeval once a face
a little face that yet i dream upon
<|endoftext|>

and i could walk and went
led by the hand through a long mead at morn
bathed in a ravishing excess of light
<|endoftext|>

awhile our feeding hearts all satisfied
took in the blue of one another's eyes
two dimpled creatures rose-lipped innocent
<|endoftext|>

'you're sure it was the queen
'of course a crown
was on her and a spangly purple gown
<|endoftext|>

here they were beggar children in the street
and the dove said they had the prettiest things
and wore their best frocks every day
<|endoftext|>

'o yes and lined with white
like swallow wings so soft so very light
fluttering about
<|endoftext|>

oft as in a dream i see full fain
the bell-tower beautiful that i love well
a seemly cluster with her churches twain
<|endoftext|>

ay gone
the soft deceptive echoes roll
away and faint into remoteness
<|endoftext|>

or thus of old men feigned and then did fear
then straight crowd forth the great ones of the sky
in flashing flame at strife to reach more near
<|endoftext|>

wait and desire it life waits not free there
to good to evil thy right perilous
all shall be fair and yet it is not fair
<|endoftext|>

is it the many fall'n shall lift the land
the race the age
nay 't is the few that stand
<|endoftext|>

i sought to look as in the light of one
returned
'will this be strange to me that day
<|endoftext|>

oh let her speak with her best eloquence
to me but not her first and her right rare
can equal what i may not take from hence
<|endoftext|>

'great oaks' methought as i drew near to gaze
'were but of small account when these came down
drawn rough-hewn in to serve the tree-girt town
<|endoftext|>

she leaned against the pillar and below
three almost babes her care she watched the while
with downcast lashes and a musing smile
<|endoftext|>

her cheeks like winter apples red of hue
her glance aside
to whom her speech to me
<|endoftext|>

farewell good dame
lost
oh my lady lost
<|endoftext|>

thus with myself i spoke
a rough brick floor
made the place homely i would rest me there
<|endoftext|>

hath the most high of all his host afar
one most supremely beautiful one best
dearest of all the flock one favourite star
<|endoftext|>

his image given in part the children know
they love one first and best
it may be so
<|endoftext|>

there are on fortune's errant foot can steal
can guide her blindfold in at their own doors
or dance elate upon her slippery wheel
<|endoftext|>

courage
there are 'gainst hope can still advance
dowered with a sane a wise extravagance
<|endoftext|>

a long-waking aye waking till a word
come from her coral mouth to be the true
sum of all good heart wanted ear hath heard
<|endoftext|>

yet if alas
might love thy dolour be
dream dear heart dear and do not dream of me
<|endoftext|>

store make in loving make o make mine art
more
yet i ask no ask no wished goal
<|endoftext|>

that was the end
'slow solemn growth of light
come what come will remains to me this night
<|endoftext|>

it was the end with dew ordained to melt
how easily was learned how all too soon
not there not thereabout such maiden dwelt
<|endoftext|>

unhappy love
and i of that great host
unhappy love who cry unhappy most
<|endoftext|>

then saw her demon blush vesuvius try
then evil ghosts white from the awful prime
thrust up sharp peaks to tear the tender sky
<|endoftext|>

the stroke of noon
the bell-bird
yes and no
<|endoftext|>

a footstep near
i turned past likelihood
past hope before me on the bridge she stood
<|endoftext|>

on moorish walls yet hung long dust each hand
the keys but not the might to use remain
is there such house in some blest land for me
<|endoftext|>

a country conquered oft and long before
of generations aye ordained to win
if mine the power i will unlock the door
<|endoftext|>

what did the crescent wane
yet man is more
and love achieves because to heaven akin
<|endoftext|>

o life
to hear again that wandering bell
and hear it at thy feet estelle estelle
<|endoftext|>

in earlier days great carthage suffered bale
and reckless hands tore down the temple veil
and omar burned the alexandrian rolls
<|endoftext|>

'let me alone mine enemy let me alone
never a christian bell that dire thick gloom to hallow
or guide him shelterless succourless thrust from his own
<|endoftext|>

on the wall his golden shield
dinted deep in battle field
when the host o' the khalif fled
<|endoftext|>

gold to gold
long sunbeams flit
upward tremble and break on it
<|endoftext|>

comes a day for glory famed
tidings brought the enemy shamed
fallen now is peace proclaimed
<|endoftext|>

now the valley mist doth break
shifting sparkles edge the lake
love lord master wake o wake
<|endoftext|>

ay it is not thrust o' a spear
scorn of infidel eyes austere
but mine own fear is to fear
<|endoftext|>

'love ' she sigheth 'thou didst not well
listening to the white-witch fell
leaving her doth thee advance
<|endoftext|>

fifty candles burn at his head and burn at his feet
a crown and royal apparel upon him lorn and lowly
and the cold hands stiff as horn by their cold palms meet
<|endoftext|>

two days dead
is he dead
nay nay but is he living
<|endoftext|>

the weary monks have ended their chantings manifold
the great door swings behind them night winds entrance giving
the candles flare and drip on him warm and he so cold
<|endoftext|>

the pale queen's honour
a low laugh scathing and sereing
a mumbling as made by the dead in the tombs ye wot
<|endoftext|>

braveth the dead this queen
'hear it whoso hath hearing
i vowed by my love cold king but i loved thee not
<|endoftext|>

thou dost take thy good things first
then thou art cast into the worst
first the glory then the strife
<|endoftext|>

as one reasoning with a child
all his speech): 'my wife
my fair
<|endoftext|>

and his hand on her brown hair
trembles 'lady dost indeed
weigh the meaning of thy rede
<|endoftext|>

soh
a pillar misty and grey
't is the white-witch in the way
<|endoftext|>

shelter at the last a roof
wrought of ling (in their behoof
foresters that drive the deer
<|endoftext|>

ay and ere the twilight fall
gather forest berries small
and nuts down beaten for a meal
<|endoftext|>

list
about and around us wondrous sweet noises
laughter of little children and maids that dreaming be
<|endoftext|>

'speak dear child dear ' quoth the queen 'and mine own little son
'father ' the small thing murmurs then all is ended
he starts from that passion of peace ay the dream is done
<|endoftext|>

till a tower shall on thee frown
him that holds it show this ring
so farewell my lord the king
<|endoftext|>

'tis the whole world whereon they lie
the rocky pastures hung on high
shelve off upon an empty sky
<|endoftext|>

faint as the light of stars and wan
as snow at night when the moon is gone
it is the white-witch risen once more
<|endoftext|>

the white-witch that tempted of yore
so utterly doth substance lack
you may breathe her nearer and breathe her back
<|endoftext|>

soft her eyes her speech full clear
'hail thou sigismund my fere
bargain with me yea or nay
<|endoftext|>

yea the good be all thine own
for now will i advance thy day
and yet will leave the night alone
<|endoftext|>

though the highest heaped on me
trouble yet the same should be
welcomer than weal from thee
<|endoftext|>

sigismund show us the boy is he safe and his mother
sigismund
' dreaming he falls into laughter and wakes
<|endoftext|>

he raves
fool
thou'lt hear more of this anon
<|endoftext|>

but none did question me
a beldame old
kind heedless of my sayings tended me
<|endoftext|>

father and mother mother and father kind
so young so innocent had ye no ruth
no fear that ye did bring her to her doom
<|endoftext|>

parted in hiding some other in thrall
father and mother mother and father kind
it may be yet ye know not this not all
<|endoftext|>

but after pause i felt a hand let down
that rested kindly firmly a man's hand
upon my shoulder there was cheer in it
<|endoftext|>

then took a key opened and crying 'delia
delia my sweetheart i am come i am come
i darted forward and he locked us in
<|endoftext|>

but for that other while she stood appeased
for cruel parting past locked in mine arms
i had been glad expecting a good end
<|endoftext|>

there was a day when to the wilderness
my great forerunner from his thrall sent forth
sad messengers demanding art thou he
<|endoftext|>

how could i hold the power and want the will
or want the love
that pang was his and mine
<|endoftext|>

one drew i to the opening on it set
my delia kneeled upon its arm laid mine
and prayed to god and prayed of her
<|endoftext|>

truly unless my soul i would have bound
with false oaths difficult innumerous strong
way was not left me to get free
<|endoftext|>

but now
said she i am happy i have seen the place
where i am going
<|endoftext|>

pray you make haste
i know not haste he said
i was not fashioned to be thrall of time
<|endoftext|>

the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning
more kin to death of night than birth of morn
peered o'er yon hill bristling with spires of pine
<|endoftext|>

i knew this man for him who spoke with me
letting me see my delia
i looked up
<|endoftext|>

am i a fiend
no he was good to me
almost he placed his life in my hand
<|endoftext|>

she is no mother of mine she slew my love
what answer
'peace peace thou art hard on me
<|endoftext|>

but god is greater than the church
i hope
he shall not for that he loved men lose god
<|endoftext|>

i have no vision but where vision fails
faith cheers and truly truly there is need
the god of this world being so unkind
<|endoftext|>

i cannot fathom them
there is not time
so quickly men condemned me to this cell
<|endoftext|>

and now he knows i would believe e'en so
as pleaseth him an there was time to learn
or certitude of heart but time fails time
<|endoftext|>

he knoweth also 't were a piteous thing
not to be sure of my love's welfare not
to see her happy and good in that new home
<|endoftext|>

white ashes and a waft of vapour i
to flutter on before the winds
no no
<|endoftext|>

and yet for ever ay my flesh shall hiss
and i shall hear 't
dreadful unbearable
<|endoftext|>

i have waked long
and cannot hold my thoughts upon th' event
they slip they wander forth
<|endoftext|>

you tremble alas and alas you heard bad news from the town
'only one short half hour to tell it
my poor courage fails
<|endoftext|>

and the time is come ronald knows nothing your father will go
as the shadow fades from its place will he and be seen no more
'there 'll be time to think to-morrow and after but to-day no
<|endoftext|>

now scarlet o look
overcoming the blue both lake and sky
while the waterfalls waver like smoke then leap in and are not
<|endoftext|>

ah
here is your ring see i draw it off it must not be mine
put it on love if but for the moment and listen to me
<|endoftext|>

you might give your name to my father's child
' 'my father's name
ay
<|endoftext|>

i clomb full high the belfry tower
up to yon arrow-slit up and away
i said 'let me look on my heart's fair flower
<|endoftext|>

my care she knoweth not no nor the cause
white rose red rose about her hung
and i aloft with the doves and the daws
<|endoftext|>

the pity of it
love's a rover
the last word said and all over
<|endoftext|>

quoth the brown bee
'in thy white wear
four thou art fair
<|endoftext|>

but as for me
i ' quoth the bee
'never am fair
<|endoftext|>

the little ones care not
and i fare not
amiss with thee
<|endoftext|>

ay thou full fain
in the soft rain
shalt sing again
<|endoftext|>

a fair wife making her moan despised forsaken
her good days o'er
seven no more
<|endoftext|>

an all-sufficient world
and as it seems an undiscovered world
so very few the folk that come to look
<|endoftext|>

and so the world was sweet and it was strange
sweet as a bee-kiss to the crocus flower
surprising fresh direct but ever one
<|endoftext|>

whate'er she wanted wanted all
o how
't was poignant her rich voice not like a bird's
<|endoftext|>

could she not dwell content and let them be
that they might take their pleasure in the town
for no she was not poor witness the pence
<|endoftext|>

but now
they closed the shops the wild clear voice was still
the beggars moved away where was their home
<|endoftext|>

white as white butterflies that each one dons
her face their wide white wings to shade withal
many moon-daisies throng the water-spring
<|endoftext|>

may be their plaint when we shall meet again
and make our peace with them the sea of life
find flowing full nor ought or lost or vain
<|endoftext|>

shall the vague hint whereof all thought is rife
the sweet pathetic guess indeed come true
and things restored reach that great residue
<|endoftext|>

to stay my pleading 'take me to church and give me my ring
'you should have spoken before ' he had sighed when i prayed him so
for his heart was sick for himself and me and this bitter thing
<|endoftext|>

but spare me the ending
i did not wait to be quite cast away
i left him asleep and the bare sun rising shone red on my gown
<|endoftext|>

look back they must and show thee thy fair past
or choosing thy to-day they may but chant
as they behold
<|endoftext|>

it may be god's first work is but to breathe
and fill the abysm with drifts of shining air
that slowly slowly curdle into worlds
<|endoftext|>

go up go mark the whiteness of the snow thy
faith is not thy saviour not thy god
though faith waste fruitless down a desert old
<|endoftext|>

then straightway flashes up athwart the words
and if i be a son i am very far
from my great father's house i am not clean
<|endoftext|>

ay he shall come in truth to visit thee
and thou shalt mourn to him unclean unclean
but never more i will to have it so
<|endoftext|>

from henceforth thou shalt learn that there is love
to long for pureness to desire a mount
of consecration it were good to scale
<|endoftext|>

this that i bear what is it
me no less
it binds i cannot disenslave my soul
<|endoftext|>

for even thus it is with them: the day
waxeth to wane anon and a long night
leaves the dark heart unsatisfied with stars
<|endoftext|>

my want is god's desire to give he yearns
to add himself to life and so for aye
make it enough
<|endoftext|>

hard lines it gives them cold and dirt abhorred
hunger and nakedness in lieu of love
and blows instead of care
<|endoftext|>

with that his hand
he laid upon a latch and lifted it
looked in full quietly and entered straight
<|endoftext|>

now in that town there was an ancient church
a minster of old days which these had turned
to parish uses: there the curate served
<|endoftext|>

and when the verger gave he moved with him
toward the door distraught then shut him out
and locked himself within the church alone
<|endoftext|>

my heart is darkened and unclean
ah me
to be a man and yet to tremble so
<|endoftext|>

till the strong angels pitiless and stern
but to them loving ever sweep them in
by armsful to the unapproachable fold
<|endoftext|>

i would fain
said he have heard some more
and wilt thou go
<|endoftext|>

and straight the little child put forth his hand
and touched him
master master hush
<|endoftext|>

the curate murmured when he came again
to himself and looked about him
this is strange
<|endoftext|>

there lieth at my feet frail white and dead
the sometime beggar
he is happy now
<|endoftext|>

there must be something wrong
look to it: let us mend our ways
farewell
<|endoftext|>

a thought from his heart doth reach to hers
come down o lady
to me
<|endoftext|>

behold him
with the flock he wons
along yon grassy lea
<|endoftext|>

oh
well is me she saith when day
draws on to eventide
<|endoftext|>

my shepherd lord
i see him not
but he will come again
<|endoftext|>

while he slumbered who can answer for what dreams they may have brought
him
when at midnight all was still
<|endoftext|>

father
mother
must you leave him on his bed but not to slumber
<|endoftext|>

surely no
i will be silent in your soul is no reflection
of the care that burdens mine
<|endoftext|>

is it so my little henry
are we set so far asunder
who were wont to be so near
<|endoftext|>

be thou near each chastened spirit for its course and conflict nerving
let thy voice say father mother lo
thy treasures live above
<|endoftext|>

then by one man's intercession standing clear from their transgression
father mother you shall meet them fairer than they were before
ay for ever evermore
<|endoftext|>

let her rapt dreamy smile
the wondering heart beguile
that almost thinks to hear a calm contented sigh
<|endoftext|>

what trance-like peace is shed
on her reclining head
and e'en on listless feet what languor of repose
<|endoftext|>

hearing of that blest shore
she thinks on earth no more
contented to forego this wintry land
<|endoftext|>

she has nor thought nor care
but to rest calmly there
and hold the snowdrops pale that blossom in her hand
<|endoftext|>

the young lips seem to say
i have wept much to-day
and felt some bitter pains but they are over now
<|endoftext|>

what is the world
it is a waiting place
where men put on their robes for that above
<|endoftext|>

what is the new world
'tis a father's face
beholden of his sons the face of love
<|endoftext|>

o night of nights
o night
desired of man so long
<|endoftext|>

the waits of heaven to hear
oh
what it must have been
<|endoftext|>

then wilt thou wipe away our tears
and comfort in th' all-hallow'd spheres
them that weep now
<|endoftext|>

calm lie the desert pools in a fair wilderness
wind-shaken moves the reed so moves his voice the soul
sick folk surprised of joy wax when they hear it whole
<|endoftext|>

but what
his doom yet eating of that tree
had been immortal life of shame and sin
<|endoftext|>

where yet th' immortalizing tree doth grow
he shall there meet us and once more reveal
the fruit of life where crime is not nor woe
<|endoftext|>

men say we differ'd they speak amiss
this man and i were neighbors ever
i would have ventured my life for his
<|endoftext|>

sheltered and safe under roses blown
'_storm cannot touch me hail nor shower
where all alone i sit all alone
<|endoftext|>

mercy is startled and fain would fly
but e'en as she turns her steps o'ertaking
he pleads with her mercy it is but i
<|endoftext|>

thine like thus differs form and presence laid
it is the unseen shade which risen hath pressed
above all heights where feet olympian strayed
<|endoftext|>

a cottager leaned whispering by her hives
telling the bees some news as they lit down
and entered one by one their waxen town
<|endoftext|>

and they are days when drops a veil
a mist upon the distance past
and while we say to peace all hail
<|endoftext|>

dark fell the skies when once belated
sad and sorrow-fated i missed the sun
but wake heart and sing for not in vain i waited
<|endoftext|>

leave the garden walls where blow
apple-blossoms pink and low
ordered beds of tulips fine
<|endoftext|>

who hath most he yearneth most
sure as seldom heretofore
somewhere of the gracious more
<|endoftext|>

for fuel at the ebb yon fair expanse
is strewed with driftwood by the breaking wave
and in the sea is fish for sustenance
<|endoftext|>

i will build up the entrance of the cave
and leave therein a window and a door
and here will dwell and leave it nevermore
<|endoftext|>

and soothed him long until the storm was spent
and the last thunder peal had died away
and stars were out in all the firmament
<|endoftext|>

then did he cease to moan and slumbering lay
while in the welcome silence pure and deep
the care-worn parents sweetly fell asleep
<|endoftext|>

once to that cottage door
in happy days of yore
my little love made footprints in the snow
<|endoftext|>

she was so glad of spring
she helped the birds to sing
i know she dwells there yet the rest i do not know
<|endoftext|>

i think but cannot tell
i think she loved me well
and some dear fancy with my future twined
<|endoftext|>

but i shall never know
hope faints and lets it go
that passionate want forbid to speak its mind
<|endoftext|>

and that's the best of it all
and when she blushes my heart so yearns
that tears are ready to fall
<|endoftext|>

in their cups on yonder lea
cowslips fold the brown bee's diet
so the moss enfoldeth thee
<|endoftext|>

i'd bear the long hours through
thou should'st forget and my sad breast
the sorrows twain should rue
<|endoftext|>

the ring was a world too fine
and would it had sunk in a forty-fathom sea
ere the morn that made it mine
<|endoftext|>

reach me life's wine and gold
what is man's best all told
if thou thyself withhold sweet from thy throne
<|endoftext|>

o my liege lady
and o my loved lady
and o my heart's lady come reign there alone
<|endoftext|>

'tis all gold and snow
save where scarlet waves are hurled
down yon gulf below
<|endoftext|>

drop drop from the leaves of lign aloes
o honey-dew
drop from the tree
<|endoftext|>

what's the good though i be fair
for thou'lt never see me mair
man johnnie
<|endoftext|>

fain would i thy small limbs fold
while the weary hours are told
little babe in cradle cold
<|endoftext|>

long watchings leave behind them little trace
and yet how sweetly must the mornings pass
that bring that dreamy calmness to thy face
<|endoftext|>

thy cheek is resting on thy hand thine eyes
are like twin violets but half unclosed
and quiet as the deeps in yonder skies
<|endoftext|>

never more peacefully in love reposed
a mother's gaze upon her offspring dear
than thine upon the long far-stretching mere
<|endoftext|>

it faded and she never saw it more
nor any human eye oh grief
oh woe
<|endoftext|>

how could he be so late
and then hope fled
and disappointment darkened into dread
<|endoftext|>

he journeyed on and as he neared the gate
he met with one to whom he named the maid
inquiring of her welfare and her state
<|endoftext|>

thou also thou
must nobly do thy part
that honor leads thee on which holds back me
<|endoftext|>

be not thy gratitude deceived
i know
thou think'st it is thy duty i will go
<|endoftext|>

one year there was fulfilled of happiness
but o
it went so fast too fast away
<|endoftext|>

the flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint
when in the darkness waiting he saw one
to whom he said how fareth my sweet saint
<|endoftext|>

who answered she hath borne to you a son
then turning left him and the father said
god rain down blessings on his welcome head
<|endoftext|>

woe and alas
the times of sorrow come
and make us doubt if we were ever glad
<|endoftext|>

for sir though men be evil yet the deep
they dread and at the last will surely turn
to him and he long-suffering will forgive
<|endoftext|>

he saith again: i pray thee woman peace
for thou wilt enter when that day appears
the fateful ship
<|endoftext|>

then at the last i cried
'if the unseen be silent i will speak
and certify my meaning to myself
<|endoftext|>

did they not spend much gear to gather out
such as i tell of and for matching them
one with another for a thousand years
<|endoftext|>

what harm then if there came of it a race
inferior in their wits and in their size
and well content to serve
<|endoftext|>

my mother was full old when i was born
and that was in her youth
what think you sir
<|endoftext|>

and they are proud against the king of heaven
they hope in course of ages they shall come
to be as strong as he
<|endoftext|>

laugh
o my heart
i would the voice were stilled
<|endoftext|>

then light and cry to him 'great king the son
of old methuselah thy son hath sent
to fetch the growing maids his children home
<|endoftext|>

but will the voice think you forbear to chide
nor that unseen who calleth buffet thee
and drive thee on
<|endoftext|>

the giant elephants be cunning folk
they lie in ambush and will draw men on
to follow then will turn and tread them down
<|endoftext|>

i must sit joyless in my place bereft
as trees that suddenly have dropped their leaves
and dark as nights that have no moon
<|endoftext|>

i know it quoth he and she said again
the elder learning thou wouldst pass hath sent
to fetch thee then he rose and followed her
<|endoftext|>

i looked it was a dream let no man say
it was aught else
there so the fit goes by
<|endoftext|>

sir and my daughters is it eventide
sooner than that saith old methuselah
let the vulture lay his beak to my green limbs
<|endoftext|>

would he could steal from thee one secret more
the secret of thy youth
o envious god
<|endoftext|>

we die
the words of old methuselah
and his prophecy are ended
<|endoftext|>

cowards
i heard them winnow their great wings
they went to tell him but they came no more
<|endoftext|>

'behold  behold
the earth that i made green cries out to me
red with the costly blood of beauteous man
<|endoftext|>

thus marked he glowing on the branched moss
those red rare moons and let his serpent eyes
consider them full subtly what be these
<|endoftext|>

then egg-like cracked the glowing balls and forth
started black angels trampling hard to free
their fettered feet from out the smoking shell
<|endoftext|>

and when he looked
the dragon cried thou newly-fashioned thing
of name unknown thy scorn becomes thee not
<|endoftext|>

but the dragon left a-tremble called to him
from the nether kingdom certain of his friends
three whom he trusted councillors accursed
<|endoftext|>

or i most miserable hold my life
over the airless bottomless gulf and bide
the buffetings of yonder shoreless sea
<|endoftext|>

a spirit rose and spake
whereas in heaven is power is much to fear
for this admired country we have marred
<|endoftext|>

what if thy slaves by thy consent should take
and bear thee on their wings above the earth
and suddenly let fall how soon 't were o'er
<|endoftext|>

and while the sullen camels moved he spake
to him that led the last there are but two
of these my sons but where doth japhet ride
<|endoftext|>

that i have looked to for my solacing
in the bitterness to come
my children dear
<|endoftext|>

and is this mine
said he my son
mine own
<|endoftext|>

so japhet said
sir i am young but of my mother straight
i will go ask a wife that this may be
<|endoftext|>

'tis not the manner of our kin to wed
so young
thou knowest it art thou not ashamed
<|endoftext|>

for all did scorn her
nay they cried
o fool
<|endoftext|>

o japhet well-beloved
and she rose up
and did restrain herself saying dost thou heed
<|endoftext|>

japhet spoke
he said my father's slave and she replied
low drooping her fair head my master's son
<|endoftext|>

nay but for mine
get hence
obey my words
<|endoftext|>

japhet said o maid
sweet are thy words but what if i return
and all again be as it is to-day
<|endoftext|>

though ye shall find it even as i had died
silent for any words i might have said
empty for any space i might have filled
<|endoftext|>

then he rose
and put aside the curtains of the tent
to look upon his father's face and lo
<|endoftext|>

then came a messenger while japhet sat
mournfully and he said the men of might
are willing let thy master youth appear
<|endoftext|>

ye mighty ones
it hath been known to you these many days
how that for piety i am much famed
<|endoftext|>

and satan answered nay you
be not wroth
yet true it is and yet not all the truth
<|endoftext|>

thereat the great leader laughed for scorn
hold snake
if god be just there shall be reckoning days
<|endoftext|>

turn now thy reason to the other side
and speak for that for as to justice snake
we would have none of it
<|endoftext|>

should i forbear
that have been patient
i will not forbear
<|endoftext|>

'but yet ' saith he
'repent and turn you
wherefore will ye die
<|endoftext|>

turn then o turn while yet the enemy
untamed of man fatefully moans afar
for if ye will not turn the doom is near
<|endoftext|>

then shall the crested wave make sport and beat
you mighty at your doors
will ye be wroth
<|endoftext|>

repent and turn thee from thine evil ways
o son
and no more dare the wrath of love
<|endoftext|>

they said a man or false or fanatic
may claim good audience if he fill our ears
with what is strange: and we would hear again
<|endoftext|>

then one to japhet said
one called the cedar-tree dost thou too think
to reign upon our lands when we lie drowned
<|endoftext|>

and he related to them all his ways
from the beginning: of the voice that called
moreover how the ship of doom was built
<|endoftext|>

he then replied
what is thy thought
there is no miracle
<|endoftext|>

but i have found another yea good sooth
the damsel will not tarry she will come
with all her slaves by sundown
<|endoftext|>

and she said
comfort thy heart and eat: moreover know
how that thy great work even to-day is done
<|endoftext|>

for this i make thee free
and now thyself
art loveliest in mine eyes i look and lo
<|endoftext|>

with that
she answered let this woman sir find grace
and favor in your sight
<|endoftext|>

but yet said he o yet
if there be respite for the terrible
the proud yea such as scorn thee and if not
<|endoftext|>

and at his feet
the wives of his two other sons did kneel
and wring their hands
<|endoftext|>

o is it come to this
he answered them
the door is shut
<|endoftext|>

the quivering butterflies in companies
that slowly crept adown the sandy marge
like living crocus beds
<|endoftext|>

a birthday song
to s

<|endoftext|>

i will make to thee a little confession of faith telling thee
my dearer self in words what i do not say to my not-so-dear-self
except in more modest feeling

mrs
lanier's own words as written in the brief annals of his life

this is not the place for an essay on the genius of sidney lanier
it is enough to call attention to some marked points
in his character and work
<|endoftext|>

whitman is poetry's butcher
huge raw collops slashed from the rump
of poetry and never mind gristle  is what whitman feeds our souls with
<|endoftext|>

as near as i can make it out whitman's argument seems to be that
because a prairie is wide therefore debauchery is admirable
and because the mississippi is long therefore every american is god
<|endoftext|>

liberty patriotism and civilization are on their knees
before the men of the south and with clasped hands and straining eyes
are begging them to become christians

tell me sweet burly-bark'd man-bodied tree
that mine arms in the dark are embracing dost know
from what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow
<|endoftext|>

my gossip the owl  is it thou
that out of the leaves of the low-hanging bough
as i pass to the beach art stirred
<|endoftext|>

oh what if a bound should be laid
to this bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence a-spring
to the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string
<|endoftext|>

in my heart
is a motion made
'tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade
<|endoftext|>

yet now the dew-drop now the morning gray
shall live their little lucid sober day
ere with the sun their souls exhale away
<|endoftext|>

still-eyed and shadow-brow'd
steal off from yon far-drifting crowd
and come and brood upon the marsh with me
<|endoftext|>

how poor how strange how wrong
to dream he wrote the little song
i made to him with love's unforced design
<|endoftext|>

i work in freedom wild
but work as plays a little child
sure of the father self and love alone
<|endoftext|>

inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl
as a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows
the firm sweet limbs of a girl
<|endoftext|>

somehow my soul seems suddenly free
from the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin
by the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of glynn
<|endoftext|>

the midmorn empties you of men save me
speak to your lover meadows
none can hear
<|endoftext|>

i lie as lies yon placid brandywine
holding the hills and heavens in my heart
for contemplation
<|endoftext|>

woods and wet pillows
this was all
this ox
<|endoftext|>

from here to where the louder passions dwell
green leagues of hilly separation roll
trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell
<|endoftext|>

but oh not the hills of habersham
and oh not the valleys of hall
avail: i am fain for to water the plain
<|endoftext|>

then down he shot bounced airily along
the sward twitched in a grasshopper made song
midflight perched prinked and to his art again
<|endoftext|>

sweet science this large riddle read me plain
how may the death of that dull insect be
the life of yon trim shakespeare on the tree
<|endoftext|>

burn golden globes in leafy sky
my orange-planets: crimson i
will shine and shoot among the spheres
<|endoftext|>

then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all
ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall
and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong
<|endoftext|>

they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea
and the lady cries: clansmen run for a fee
yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold
<|endoftext|>

fast hamish back from the brink
and ever she flies up the steep
and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
<|endoftext|>

when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height
and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight
of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong
<|endoftext|>

e'en when thou strivest there within art's sky
full calm thine image in our love doth lie
a motion glassed in a tranquillity
<|endoftext|>

frowning the owl in the oak complained him
sore that the song of the robin restrained him
wrongly of slumber rudely of rest
<|endoftext|>

and cannot you walk now
bah
don't hop
<|endoftext|>

soul could'st thou bare thy breast
as yon red rose and dare the day
all clean and large and calm with velvet rest
<|endoftext|>

to-day the woods are trembling through and through
with shimmering forms that flash before my view
then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue
<|endoftext|>

i pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy
that hide like gentle nuns from human eye
to lift adoring perfumes to the sky
<|endoftext|>

i hear faint bridal-sighs of brown and green
dying to silent hints of kisses keen
as far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen
<|endoftext|>

i start at fragmentary whispers blown
from undertalks of leafy souls unknown
vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone
<|endoftext|>

thus without theft i reap another's field
thus without tilth i house a wondrous yield
and heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed
<|endoftext|>

scorning the slow reward of patient grain
he sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain
then sat him down and waited for the rain
<|endoftext|>

he sailed in borrowed ships of usury
a foolish jason on a treacherous sea
seeking the fleece and finding misery
<|endoftext|>

lulled by smooth-rippling loans in idle trance
he lay content that unthrift circumstance
should plough for him the stony field of chance
<|endoftext|>

yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell
he staked his life on games of buy-and-sell
and turned each field into a gambler's hell
<|endoftext|>

aye as each year declined
with bitter heart and ever-brooding mind
he mourned his fate unkind
<|endoftext|>

then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest
he fled away into the oblivious west
unmourned unblest
<|endoftext|>

o trade
o trade
would thou wert dead
<|endoftext|>

swinehood hath no remedy
say many men and hasten by
clamping the nose and blinking the eye
<|endoftext|>

but who said once in the lordly tone
man shall not live by bread alone
but all that cometh from the throne
<|endoftext|>

does business mean `die you  live i
then `trade is trade' but sings a lie
'tis only war grown miserly
<|endoftext|>

if business is battle name it so
war-crimes less will shame it so
and widows less will blame it so
<|endoftext|>

alas for the poor to have some part
in yon sweet living lands of art
makes problem not for head but heart
<|endoftext|>

i am not overbold
i hold
full powers from nature manifold
<|endoftext|>

the nymphs cold creatures of man's colder brain
chilled nature's streams till man's warm heart was fain
never to lave its love in them again
<|endoftext|>

later a sweet voice `love thy neighbor' said
then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread
beyond all confines of old ethnic dread
<|endoftext|>

but oh the poor
the poor
the poor
<|endoftext|>

alas when sighs are traders' lies
and heart's-ease eyes and violet eyes
are merchandise
<|endoftext|>

ah not in these cold merchantable days
deem men their life an opal gray where plays
the one red sweet of gracious ladies'-praise
<|endoftext|>

i'll prove that lie upon his head
or i will die instead
fair lady
<|endoftext|>

nor time hath changed his hair to white
nor his dear love to spite
fair lady
<|endoftext|>

and then the hautboy played and smiled
and sang like any large-eyed child
cool-hearted and all undefiled
<|endoftext|>

yet more i learn while friend
i sit by thee
who sees all time sees all eternity
<|endoftext|>

howe'er thou turn'st wrong earth
still love's in sight
for we are taller than the breadth of night
<|endoftext|>

time hurry my love to me
haste haste
lov'st not good company
<|endoftext|>

oh would that i might divine
thy name beyond the zodiac sign
wherefrom our times-to-come descend
<|endoftext|>

he called thee `sometime
change it friend
`now-time' sounds so much more fine
<|endoftext|>

thou canst not measure mistress nature's hair
not one sweet inch: nay if thy sight is sharp
would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp
<|endoftext|>

the tears i weep by day and bitter night
opinion
for thy sole salt vintage fall
<|endoftext|>

`i love thee well dear love ' quoth she `and yet
would that thy creed with mine completely met
as one not two
<|endoftext|>

assassin
thief
opinion 'tis thy work
<|endoftext|>

by church by throne by hearth by every good
that's in the town of time i see thee lurk
and e'er some shadow stays where thou hast stood
<|endoftext|>

a pilot god a pilot
for the helm is left awry
and the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead
<|endoftext|>

to heal his heart of long-time pain
one day prince love for to travel was fain
with ministers mind and sense
<|endoftext|>

`yea yea sweet prince thyself shalt see
wilt thou but down this slope with me
'tis palpable ' whispered sense
<|endoftext|>

at the foot of the hill a living rill
shone and the lilies shone white above
`but now 'twas black 'twas a river this rill
<|endoftext|>

`i saw true hell with mine own eye
true hell or light hath told a lie
true verily ' quoth stout sense
<|endoftext|>

there while they stood in a green wood
and marvelled still on ill and good
came suddenly minister mind
<|endoftext|>

`in the heart of sin doth hell begin
'tis not below 'tis not above
it lieth within it lieth within
<|endoftext|>

`fixed: follow me would'st thou but see
he weepeth under yon willow tree
fast chained to his corse ' quoth mind
<|endoftext|>

there when they came mind suffered shame
`these be the same and not the same
a-wondering whispered mind
<|endoftext|>

lo face by face two spirits pace
where the blissful willow waves above
one saith: `do me a friendly grace
<|endoftext|>

`read me two dreams that linger long
dim as returns of old-time song
that flicker about the mind
<|endoftext|>

`now strange ' quoth sense and `strange ' quoth mind
`we saw it and yet 'tis hard to find
but we saw it ' quoth sense and mind
<|endoftext|>

before your birth
burn up o roses
with your dainty flame
<|endoftext|>

o farms
protest if any tree emboss
the barren hills
<|endoftext|>

sheer down to earth with many minstrelsies
and motions fine and mix about the scene
and fill the time with forms of ancient mien
<|endoftext|>

o wagner westward bring thy heavenly art
no trifler thou: siegfried and wotan be
names for big ballads of the modern heart
<|endoftext|>

hey rose just born
twin to a thorn
was't so with you o love and scorn
<|endoftext|>

sweet eyes that smiled
now wet and wild
o eye and tear  mother and child
<|endoftext|>

well: love and pain
be kinsfolk twain
yet would oh would i could love again
<|endoftext|>

nay if ye three o morn
o spring
o heart
<|endoftext|>

should chant grave unisons of grief and love
ye could not mourn with more melodious art
than daily doth yon dim sequestered dove
<|endoftext|>

i asked my heart to say
some word whose worth my love's devoir might pay
upon my lady's natal day
<|endoftext|>

then said my heart to me
`learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee
what fits thy love most lovingly
<|endoftext|>

this gift that learning shows
for as a rhyme unto its rhyme-twin goes
i send a rose unto a rose
<|endoftext|>

in four brief cycles round the punctual sun
has she old learning's latest daughter won
this grace this stature and this fruitful fame
<|endoftext|>

one wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost past
and one with the dreams of a prophet and both sailed fast
and met where the sorrowful soul on the earth was cast
<|endoftext|>

then that artist began in a lark's low circling to pass
and first he sang at the height of the top of the grass
a song of the herds that are born and die in the mass
<|endoftext|>

but god was not angry nor ever confused his tongue
for not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung
the song of all men and all things that the all-lover sung
<|endoftext|>

yet as `a ghost
' his household cry
`he hath followed a ghost in flight
<|endoftext|>

yea would i rode these mad contentious brawls
no damage taking from their if and how
nor no result save galloping to my dawn
<|endoftext|>

my dawn
my dawn
how if it never break
<|endoftext|>

come ye wild weeks since first this canvas drew
out of vexed palos ere the dawn was blue
o'er milky waves about the bows full-creaming
<|endoftext|>

i marvel how mine eye ranging the night
from its big circling ever absently
returns thou large low star to fix on thee
<|endoftext|>

john parker
rub thine eyes and yawn
but one o'clock and yet 'tis dawn
<|endoftext|>

`lay down your arms damned rebels
' cry
the men in red full haughtily
<|endoftext|>

they sit in the reverend hall: `shall we declare
floats round about the anxious-quivering air
'twixt narrow schuylkill and broad delaware
<|endoftext|>

now fall the chill reactionary snows
of man's defect and every wind that blows
keeps back the spring of freedom's perfect rose
<|endoftext|>

now naked feet with crimson fleck the ways
and heaven is stained with flags that mutinies raise
and arnold-spotted move the creeping days
<|endoftext|>

burns the land with redder flame
north in line and south in line
yell the charge and spring the mine
<|endoftext|>

heartstrong south would have his way
headstrong north hath said him nay
o strong heart strong brain beware
<|endoftext|>

`blow herald blow
' there entered heart
a youth in crimson and gold
<|endoftext|>

`blow herald blow
' brain stood apart
steel-armored glittering cold
<|endoftext|>

heart and brain
no more be twain
throb and think one flesh again
<|endoftext|>

drive them homeward herdsman time
from the meadows of the prime
i will feast my house and rest
<|endoftext|>

then called the artist's god from in the sky
this time shall show by dream and mystery
the heart of all his matter to thine eye
<|endoftext|>

son study stars by looking down in streams
interpret that which is by that which seems
and tell thy dreams in words which are but dreams
<|endoftext|>

and the middle of the day is cold
and the heart of eve beats lax i' the end
as a legend's climax poorly told
<|endoftext|>

look off dear love across the sallow sands
and mark yon meeting of the sun and sea
how long they kiss in sight of all the lands
<|endoftext|>

o night
divorce our sun and sky apart
never our lips our hands
<|endoftext|>

and next marched forth a matron ewe
udder'd so large 'twas much ado
e'en then to clear the barrier
<|endoftext|>

then while the ewe
slow passed the bend a blur of light
the shepherd's face in sadness grew
<|endoftext|>

till presently no man can say
if yet the brown-fleeced wether may
or not have passed beyond the bend
<|endoftext|>

now blessed vision
to my hand
most pat a marvel strange did fall
<|endoftext|>

he cried leapt up in wild alarm
ran to my comrade shelter took
beneath the startled mother's arm
<|endoftext|>

we've had such hard hard times this year
for goblins
never knew the like
<|endoftext|>

all elfland's mortgaged
and we fear
the gnomes are just about to strike
<|endoftext|>

`we'll touch at every chimney-top
then as we whisk you by you'll drop
each package down: just think the force
<|endoftext|>

ah claus those premiums
now our lives
depend on yours: thus griefs go on
<|endoftext|>

ne'er shall my boys my boys
when christmas morns their eyes unclose
find empty stockings gaping wide
<|endoftext|>

a shape
appeared before me pacing to and fro
with head far down inclined
<|endoftext|>

don't think about it much  preehaps
your brain might git see-sawin' end for end
like them asylum chaps
<|endoftext|>

and thar it is down all squar and straight
but i can't make it gee fur nine from eight
leaves nuthin'  and none to carry
<|endoftext|>

however you star' and frown
thare's somethin' fur you to carry
fur you've worked it upside down
<|endoftext|>

you may git up soon and lie down late
but you'll always find that nine from eight
leaves nuthin'  and none to carry
<|endoftext|>

his mules was goin' powerful slow
fur he had tied the lines onto
the staple of the scraper
<|endoftext|>

thar's one thing farmers all must do
to keep themselves from goin' tew
bankruptcy and the devil
<|endoftext|>

strange aches sailed by with odors on the wind
as when we kneel in flowers that grow on graves
of friends who died unworthy of our love
<|endoftext|>

thou old red criminal stand forth i charge
but o i am too utter sorrowful
to urge large accusation now
<|endoftext|>

nathless
my work to-day is still more grievous
hear
<|endoftext|>

not mark by robust swelling of the thews
but puffed and flabby large with gross increase
of wine-fat plague-fat dropsy-fat
<|endoftext|>

o dream
born of a dream as yonder cloud is born
of water which is born of cloud
<|endoftext|>

the spectre sank and lay upon the air
and brooded level close upon the earth
with all the myriad heads just over me
<|endoftext|>

this zone seemed ever to contract and all
the frame with momentary spasms heaved
in the strangling traction which did never cease
<|endoftext|>

now if the priesthood put such shame upon
your cry for leadership can better help
come out of knighthood
<|endoftext|>

o contumely hard
o bitterness of last disgrace o sting
that stings the coward knights of lost poictiers
<|endoftext|>

then said the fool
'twas a brave flight my lord that last one
brave
<|endoftext|>

aye prove it
if thy logic fail wise fool
i'll cause two wise men whip thee soundly
<|endoftext|>

please thy wisdom
an thou dost ride through this same gang of boors
'tis my fool's-prophecy some ill shall fall
<|endoftext|>

may bounce back upward
well: and then
what then
<|endoftext|>

or if some erring crossbow-bolt should break
thine unarmed head shot from behind a house
so evil falls and a fool foretells the truth
<|endoftext|>

then all the flatterers and their squires cried out
solicitous with various voice go to
old rogue or shall i brain him my good lord
<|endoftext|>

or so let me but chuck him from his perch
or slice his tongue to piece his leg withal
or send his eyes to look for his missing arms
<|endoftext|>

the sun is brave the sun is bright
the sun is lord of love and light
but after him it cometh night
<|endoftext|>

the hound was cuffed the hound was kicked
o' the ears was cropped o' the tail was nicked
oo-hoo-o howled the hound
<|endoftext|>

an thou wert master i had slit
thy throat with a huge wound
quo' hound
<|endoftext|>

my bare thought whetted as a sword cut sheer
through time and life and flesh and death to clear
my way unto nirvana
<|endoftext|>

i thrust through antique blood and riches vast
and all big claims of the pretentious past
that hindered my nirvana
<|endoftext|>

i love not hate not: right and wrong agree
and fangs of snakes and lures of doves to me
are vain are vain nirvana
<|endoftext|>

on the still bosom of mine ecstasy
a lotus on a lake of balm i lie
forever in nirvana
<|endoftext|>

the blood that made you has all bled for us
the hearts that paid you are all dead for us
the trees that shade you groan with lead for us
<|endoftext|>

o mother-earth
of titan birth
thy mother's-milk is curdled with aloe
<|endoftext|>

thou sorrow-height
we climb by night
thou hast no hell-deep chasm save disgrace
<|endoftext|>

the sages chuckle o'er their jest
must they to give a people rest
their dainty wit forego
<|endoftext|>

a rose of perfect red embossed
with silver sheens of crystal frost
yet warm nor life nor fragrance lost
<|endoftext|>

high passion throbbing in a sphere
that art hath wrought of diamond clear
a great heart beating in a tear
<|endoftext|>

the listening soul is full of dreams
that shape the wondrous-varying themes
as cries of men or plash of streams
<|endoftext|>

or noise of summer rain-drops round
that patter daintily a-ground
with hints of heaven in the sound
<|endoftext|>

or noble wind-tones chanting free
through morning-skies across the sea
wild hymns to some strange majesty
<|endoftext|>

o if one trope clear-cut and keen
may type the art of song's best queen
white-hot of soul white-chaste of mien
<|endoftext|>

on music's heart doth nilsson dwell
as if a swedish snow-flake fell
into a glowing flower-bell
<|endoftext|>

a sweeter light than ever rayed
from star of heaven or eye of maid
has vanished in the unknown shade
<|endoftext|>

now in a wild sad after-mood
the tawny night sits still to brood
upon the dawn-time when he wooed
<|endoftext|>

star-memories of happier times
of loving deeds and lovers' rhymes
throng forth in silvery pantomimes
<|endoftext|>

a creeping rose that clomb a height of dread
out of the sea of birth all filled with dead
up to the brilliant cloud of death o'erhead
<|endoftext|>

and rose  an odor by a spirit haunted
and drew me upward with a speed enchanted

i hear men begging heaven to let them die

the three `hymns of the marshes' which open this collection

in a german daily of baltimore while the author's translation
appeared at the same time in the baltimore `gazette

but trade saith no
and the kilns and the curt-tongued mills say go
there's plenty that can if you can't: we know
<|endoftext|>

it was this profound knowledge of music of course that enabled lanier
to write his work on `the science of english verse' and gave him
a technical skill in versification akin to that of tennyson
<|endoftext|>

but to lanier the ministration of nature was by no means passive
and we find him calling upon the leaves actively to minister to his need
and even to intercede for him to their maker

significant compounds  a habit acquired no doubt

published under the general heading of `street-cries
with the two stanzas following as an introduction
<|endoftext|>

the remaining numbers of the series are:  `remonstrance

`tyranny'  `to richard wagner'  `a song of love

than are the others may be quoted

paul hamilton hayne whose love of nature rivals lanier's
has an interesting poem entitled `muscadines' (`poems' boston

thomas carew has several rose-moralities as `the true beauty

by
john r
howard
<|endoftext|>

in his introduction to ward's admirable selections from the english
poets matthew arnold critic and poet to whom allusion has already
been made says
<|endoftext|>

the future of poetry is immense because in poetry where it is
worthy of its high destinies our race as time goes on will find an
ever surer and surer stay
<|endoftext|>

but if we conceive thus highly of poetry we must also set our
standard for poetry high since poetry to be capable of fulfilling
such high destinies must be poetry of a high order of excellence
<|endoftext|>

we venture to say on the contrary paradoxical as the remark may
appear that no poet has ever had to struggle with more unfavorable
circumstances than milton
<|endoftext|>

the poem was published in  so that for at least twenty-six years
the poet was utilizing all the available resources of civilization and
scholarship to make himself more fit
<|endoftext|>

'blessings be on them and eternal praise
the poets who on earth have made us heirs
of truth and pure delight in heavenly lays
<|endoftext|>

thus the rose-spray listening
with what weird music sweet these full hearts ring

daughter of my nobler hope
that dying gave thee birth
sweet melancholy
<|endoftext|>

his liquid music from the brink
of some cloud-fountain seemed to sink
built in the blue-domed sky
<|endoftext|>

now sparkles the air all steely-bright
with drops swept down in arrow-flight
keen quivering lines
<|endoftext|>

ceased in a breath the showery sound
and teasingly now as i look around
sweet sunlight shines
<|endoftext|>

how welcome is its delicate overture
at evening when the glowing-moistur'd west
seals all things with cool promise of night's rest
<|endoftext|>

and still my soul is fain
to know the secret of that yearning
which in thine utterance i hear returning
<|endoftext|>

so however thou hast wrought
this wild joy on heart and brain
it is better left untaught
<|endoftext|>

take thou up the song again
there is nothing sad afloat
on the tide that swells thy throat
<|endoftext|>

oh sweet elixir in the blood
that makes us live with those long dead
or hope for those that shall be bred
<|endoftext|>

veiled in visionary haze
behold the ethereal autumn days
draw near again
<|endoftext|>

fair dreams farewell
so in life's stir and pride
you fade and leave the treasure of a tear
<|endoftext|>

hark to that faint ethereal twang
that from the bosom of the breeze
has caught its rise and fall: there rang
<|endoftext|>

leave me my tearless sad refrain
when in the pine-top wakes the gale
that breathes of coming rain
<|endoftext|>

at first the wind's old wayward will
drew forth the tearless sad refrain
that ceased and all was still
<|endoftext|>

or aught besides that smites that string
since then so close it knit our fates
what time the bird took wing
<|endoftext|>

scenes that i love to me always remain
beautiful whether under summer's sun
beheld or storm-dark stricken across with rain
<|endoftext|>

the breezy forests sigh in moonlit trances
and the full-hearted poet waking fancies
the smiling hills will break in laughter soon
<|endoftext|>

the wounded died ere i came up
my cup was still untasted
untasted
<|endoftext|>

't is not of these i would complain
with these i were contented
contented
<|endoftext|>

dost thou remember love those hours
shot o'er with random rainy showers
when the bold sun would woo coy may
<|endoftext|>

not always what they seek they find
when groping through dim-lighted natures
fond lovers look for old ideal statures
<|endoftext|>

oh can you spy the ancient town
the granite hills so hard and gray
that rib the land behind the bay
<|endoftext|>

three years
is it so long that we
have lived upon the lonely sea
<|endoftext|>

and for this sweetness walt her lover sought
to win her wooed her here his heart full-fraught
with fragrance of her being and gained his plea
<|endoftext|>

at last she heard no more
the neighbors said
that walt had married faithless or was dead
<|endoftext|>

so circling years went by and in her face
slow melancholy wrought a tempered grace
of early joy with sorrow's rich alloy
<|endoftext|>

he died: the creatures of his kind
fared on
not one had known his mind
<|endoftext|>

ah god
rain fire upon this foul-souled city
that gives such death and spares its men for pity

rounded strengthy limbs
that knit me to my kind
your glory turns to grief
<|endoftext|>

shall i for my soul sing hymns
yet for my body find
no clear divine belief
<|endoftext|>

yet while sin remains
on this saddened earth
humbly walk my ways
<|endoftext|>

for my garments are as chains
and i fear to praise
my frame with careless mirth
<|endoftext|>

gently sweetly she doth sorrow
what has been must be to-morrow
meekly to her fate she bows
<|endoftext|>

built in so brave a shape
how could he hope escape
the blundering people's wrath
<|endoftext|>

who seeing him strong
supposed it right to cast on him their wrong
since he could bear it all

oh on these mortal faces frail
what immortality
falls from the death-light pale
<|endoftext|>

o herald gone before
for these throw wide the door
make room make room
<|endoftext|>

now while the dumb white air
draws from our still despair
a purer prayer
<|endoftext|>

when the roweled winds are spurring

moving to salutation and the boy
from under his torn hat-brim looking answered

shadows dark and sunlight sheen
alternate come and go
<|endoftext|>

and distant voices seemed to say
it cannot be
they pass away
<|endoftext|>

o holy night
from thee i learn to bear
what man has borne before
<|endoftext|>

peace
peace
orestes-like i breathe this prayer
<|endoftext|>

descend with broad-winged flight
the welcome the thrice-prayed for the most fair
the best-beloved night
<|endoftext|>

shall i have naught that is fair
saith he
have naught but the bearded grain
<|endoftext|>

o no
from that blue tent above
a hero's armor gleams
<|endoftext|>

death with frosty hand and cold
plucks the old man by the beard
sorely sorely
<|endoftext|>

he shall so hear the solemn hymn that death
has lifted up for all that he shall go
to his long resting-place without a tear
<|endoftext|>

through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance
and rocking on the cliff was left
the dark pine blasted bare and cleft
<|endoftext|>

ye voices that arose
after the evening's close
and whispered to my restless heart repose
<|endoftext|>

go breathe it in the ear
of all who doubt and fear
and say to them be of good cheer
<|endoftext|>

ye sounds so low and calm
that in the groves of balm
seemed to me like an angel's psalm
<|endoftext|>

go mingle yet once more
with the perpetual roar
of the pine forest dark and hoar
<|endoftext|>

tongues of the dead not lost
but speaking from deaths frost
like fiery tongues at pentecost
<|endoftext|>

glimmer as funeral lamps
amid the chills and damps
of the vast plain where death encamps
<|endoftext|>

my deeds though manifold
no skald in song has told
no saga taught thee
<|endoftext|>

o father
i hear the church-bells ring
o say what may it be
<|endoftext|>

o father
i hear the sound of guns
o say what may it be
<|endoftext|>

o father
i see a gleaming light
o say what may it be
<|endoftext|>

o drooping souls whose destinies
are fraught with fear and pain
ye shall be loved again
<|endoftext|>

many a lesson deep and long
thou hast been a generous giver
i can give thee but a song
<|endoftext|>

how like quivering flames they start
when i fan the living embers
on the hearth-stone of my heart
<|endoftext|>

that my spirit leans to thee
thou hast been a generous giver
take this idle song from me
<|endoftext|>

but still above the noisy crowd
the beggar's cry is shrill and loud
until they say he calleth thee
<|endoftext|>

ye that have eyes yet cannot see
in darkness and in misery
recall those mighty voices three
<|endoftext|>

the battle of our life is brief
the alarm the struggle the relief
then sleep we side by side
<|endoftext|>

thou whose locks outshine the sun
golden tresses wreathed in one
as the braided streamlets run
<|endoftext|>

standing with reluctant feet
where the brook and river meet
womanhood and childhood fleet
<|endoftext|>

gazing with a timid glance
on the brooklet's swift advance
on the river's broad expanse
<|endoftext|>

deep and still that gliding stream
beautiful to thee must seem
as the river of a dream
<|endoftext|>

then why pause with indecision
when bright angels in thy vision
beckon thee to fields elysian
<|endoftext|>

seest thou shadows sailing by
as the dove with startled eye
sees the falcon's shadow fly
<|endoftext|>

like the swell of some sweet tune
morning rises into noon
may glides onward into june
<|endoftext|>

childhood is the bough where slumbered
birds and blossoms many-numbered
age that bough with snows encumbered
<|endoftext|>

gather then each flower that grows
when the young heart overflows
to embalm that tent of snows
<|endoftext|>

bear a lily in thy hand
gates of brass cannot withstand
one touch of that magic wand
<|endoftext|>

bear through sorrow wrong and ruth
in thy heart the dew of youth
on thy lips the smile of truth
<|endoftext|>

o that dew like balm shall steal
into wounds that cannot heal
even as sleep our eyes doth seal
<|endoftext|>

and that smile like sunshine dart
into many a sunless heart
for a smile of god thou art
<|endoftext|>

a tear stood in his bright blue eye
but still he answered with a sigh
excelsior
<|endoftext|>

this was the peasant's last good-night
a voice replied far up the height
excelsior

sang of israel's victory
sang of zion bright and free

hyp
thinking to walk in those arcadian pastures
thou hast run thy noble head against the wall

there rises from below a hand that grasp it
and waves it in the air and wailing voices
are heard along the shore

padre cura

pancho

see preciosa see how all about us
kneeling like hooded friars the misty mountains
receive the benediction of the sun
<|endoftext|>

bart
they passed this way
i hear their horses' hoofs
<|endoftext|>

yonder i see them
come sweet caramillo
this serenade shall be the gypsy's last
<|endoftext|>

ha
ha
well whistled my sweet caramillo
<|endoftext|>

well whistled
i have missed her
o my god
<|endoftext|>

in the market-place of bruges stands the belfry old and brown
thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded still it watches o'er the
town
<|endoftext|>

at my feet the city slumbered
from its chimneys here and there
wreaths of snow-white smoke ascending vanished ghost-like into air
<|endoftext|>

then the sound of drums aroused me
the awakened city's roar
chased the phantoms i had summoned back into their graves once more
<|endoftext|>

hours had passed away like minutes and before i was aware
lo
the shadow of the belfry crossed the sun-illumined square
<|endoftext|>

and every nation that should lift again
its hand against a brother on its forehead
would wear forevermore the curse of cain
<|endoftext|>

peace
and no longer from its brazen portals
the blast of war's great organ shakes the skies
<|endoftext|>

he counts it as no sin
that he sees therein
only his own thrift and gain
<|endoftext|>

once ah once within these walls
one whom memory oft recalls
the father of his country dwelt
<|endoftext|>

and yonder meadows broad and damp
the fires of the besieging camp
encircled with a burning belt
<|endoftext|>

beneath us like an oriole's pendent nest
from which the laughing birds have taken wing
by thee abandoned hangs thy vacant swing
<|endoftext|>

like the astrologers of eld
in that bright vision i beheld
greater and deeper mysteries
<|endoftext|>

sirius was rising in the east
and slow ascending one by one
the kindling constellations shone
<|endoftext|>

begirt with many a blazing star
stood the great giant algebar
orion hunter of the beast
<|endoftext|>

thus moving on with silent pace
and triumph in her sweet pale face
she reached the station of orion
<|endoftext|>

and suddenly from his outstretched arm
down fell the red skin of the lion
into the river at his feet
<|endoftext|>

wrapt in thy scarlet blanket i see thee stalk through the city's
narrow and populous streets as once by the margin of rivers
stalked those birds unknown that have left us only their footprints
<|endoftext|>

is it the cry of the foxes and crows or the mighty behemoth
who unharmed on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder
and now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man
<|endoftext|>

ha
how the breath of these saxons and celts like the blast of the east-wind
drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams
<|endoftext|>

thou hast been their friend
they alas
have left thee friendless
<|endoftext|>

from the pitcher placed between us
how the waters laugh and glisten
in the head of old silenus
<|endoftext|>

even as a miser counts his gold
those hours the ancient timepiece told
forever never
<|endoftext|>

all are scattered now and fled
some are married some are dead
and when i ask with throbs of pain
<|endoftext|>

as in the days long since gone by
the ancient timepiece makes reply
forever never
<|endoftext|>

the horologe of eternity
sayeth this incessantly
forever never
<|endoftext|>

scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october
seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean
naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand-pre
<|endoftext|>

dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant
shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood-gates
opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows
<|endoftext|>

neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
<|endoftext|>

stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters
hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snow-flakes
white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves
<|endoftext|>

but a celestial brightness a more ethereal beauty
shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession
homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her
<|endoftext|>

under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse
such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside
built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
<|endoftext|>

there too the dove-cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates
murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes
numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation
<|endoftext|>

many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal
fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion
happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
<|endoftext|>

bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
till the hives overflowed and the indian bunters asserted
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
<|endoftext|>

such was the advent of autumn
then followed that beautiful season
called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all-saints
<|endoftext|>

peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean
was for a moment consoled
all sounds were in harmony blended
<|endoftext|>

foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer
proud of her snow-white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar
quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
<|endoftext|>

faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm-chair
laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser
caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
<|endoftext|>

fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas
such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him
sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards
<|endoftext|>

silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together
<|endoftext|>

as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases
footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar
so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked
<|endoftext|>

then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith
taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside
benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
<|endoftext|>

as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's
blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken
and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered
<|endoftext|>

then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public
gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser
and what their errand may be i know not better than others
<|endoftext|>

god's name
shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith
must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore
<|endoftext|>

wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed
while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside
till evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner
<|endoftext|>

simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes-press
ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
<|endoftext|>

soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight
streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden
swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
<|endoftext|>

ah
she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with
naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
<|endoftext|>

yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness
passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
<|endoftext|>

and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass
forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps
as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar
<|endoftext|>

every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted
for with this simple people who lived like brothers together
all things were held in common and what one had was another's
<|endoftext|>

shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white
hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler
glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
<|endoftext|>

merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows
old folk and young together and children mingled among them
<|endoftext|>

silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose
louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger
and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the door-way
<|endoftext|>

flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted
down with the tyrants of england
we never have sworn them allegiance
<|endoftext|>

then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside
joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them
mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed
<|endoftext|>

busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion
wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children
left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
<|endoftext|>

back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean
dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving
inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
<|endoftext|>

onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish
wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering
like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea-shore
<|endoftext|>

vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him
vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not
but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering fire-light
<|endoftext|>

more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents
faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold
hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
<|endoftext|>

silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
<|endoftext|>

then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting
whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house-tops
started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled
<|endoftext|>

loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards
thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle
came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
<|endoftext|>

still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape
reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her
and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
<|endoftext|>

then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking
and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor
leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins
<|endoftext|>

many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand-pre
when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed
bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
<|endoftext|>

far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed
scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast
strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
<|endoftext|>

gabriel lajeunesse
they said yes
we have seen him
<|endoftext|>

gabriel lajeunesse
said others o yes
we have seen him
<|endoftext|>

are there not other youths as fair as gabriel
others
who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
<|endoftext|>

thereupon the priest her friend and father-confessor
said with a smile o daughter
thy god thus speaketh within thee
<|endoftext|>

level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river
shaded by china-trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens
stood the houses of planters with negro-cabins and dove-cots
<|endoftext|>

they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer
where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron
sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
<|endoftext|>

they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine
soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters
which like a network of steel extended in every direction
<|endoftext|>

over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid-air
waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
<|endoftext|>

deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons
home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset
or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
<|endoftext|>

lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water
gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches
down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
<|endoftext|>

then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen
and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure
sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
<|endoftext|>

nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands
darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
<|endoftext|>

after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance
as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden
said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician
<|endoftext|>

beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees
under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens
bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
<|endoftext|>

large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported
rose-wreathed vine-encircled a broad and spacious veranda
haunt of the humming-bird and the bee extended around it
<|endoftext|>

at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden
stationed the dove-cots were as love's perpetual symbol
scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals
<|endoftext|>

in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway
through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie
into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
<|endoftext|>

full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas
hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics
stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines
<|endoftext|>

thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
<|endoftext|>

all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver
fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors
brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
<|endoftext|>

here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies
here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber
with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
<|endoftext|>

after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests
no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads
burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle
<|endoftext|>

nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden
poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions
unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
<|endoftext|>

and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire-flies
wandered alone and she cried o gabriel
o my beloved
<|endoftext|>

ah
how often beneath this oak returning from labor
thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
<|endoftext|>

loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets
farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
<|endoftext|>

patience
whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness
and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded to-morrow
<|endoftext|>

bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden
bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses
with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
<|endoftext|>

farewell
answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended
down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting
<|endoftext|>

thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness
swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them
blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
<|endoftext|>

down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway
opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon
westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee
<|endoftext|>

spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies
billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine
bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas
<|endoftext|>

sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp-fire
rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall
when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
<|endoftext|>

and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary
hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana
showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them
<|endoftext|>

once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered
into the little camp an indian woman whose features
wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
<|endoftext|>

she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people
from the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel camanches
where her canadian husband a coureur-des-bois had been murdered
<|endoftext|>

touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome
gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them
on the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers
<|endoftext|>

moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion
yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her
she in turn related her love and all its disasters
<|endoftext|>

silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened
to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her
seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
<|endoftext|>

slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose
lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor
touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
<|endoftext|>

filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret
subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror
as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
<|endoftext|>

early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee
said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains
dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
<|endoftext|>

soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness
but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes
fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
<|endoftext|>

then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens
blushed at each blood-red ear for that betokened a lover
but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the corn-field
<|endoftext|>

so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not
blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird
sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
<|endoftext|>

when over weary ways by long and perilous marches
she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests
found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin
<|endoftext|>

then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead
dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthy horizon
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
<|endoftext|>

in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware's waters
guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle
stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
<|endoftext|>

there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty
and the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest
as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
<|endoftext|>

so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor
ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining
thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
<|endoftext|>

night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated
loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city
high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
<|endoftext|>

day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs
plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market
met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings
<|endoftext|>

then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city
presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons
darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
<|endoftext|>

hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever
as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals
that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
<|endoftext|>

motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted
seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness
darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking
<|endoftext|>

all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow
all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing
all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
<|endoftext|>

only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic
linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile
wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
<|endoftext|>

i hear your voices softened by the distance
and pause and turn to listen as each sends
his words of friendship comfort and assistance
<|endoftext|>

thanks for each kindly word each silent token
that teaches me when seeming most alone
friends are around us though no word be spoken
<|endoftext|>

your gentle voices will flow on forever
when life grows bare and tarnished with decay
as through a leafless landscape flows a river
<|endoftext|>

stanch and strong a goodly vessel
that shall laugh at all disaster
and with wave and whirlwind wrestle
<|endoftext|>

that silent architect the sun
had hewn and laid them every one
ere the work of man was yet begun
<|endoftext|>

beside the master when he spoke
a youth against an anchor leaning
listened to catch his slightest meaning
<|endoftext|>

only the long waves as they broke
in ripples on the pebbly beach
interrupted the old man's speech
<|endoftext|>

the sun shone on her golden hair
and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair
with the breath of morn and the soft sea air
<|endoftext|>

and when the hot long day was o'er
the young man at the master's door
sat with the maiden calm and still
<|endoftext|>

therefore he spake and thus said he
like unto ships far off at sea
outward or homeward bound are we
<|endoftext|>

ah
what pleasant visions haunt me
as i gaze upon the sea
<|endoftext|>

and with your floating bridge the ocean span
be mine to guard this light from all eclipse
be yours to bring man nearer unto man
<|endoftext|>

they were indeed too much akin
the drift-wood fire without that burned
the thoughts that burned and glowed within
<|endoftext|>

now in this crystal tower
imprisoned by some curious hand at last
it counts the passing hour
<|endoftext|>

but not for this their revels
the jovial monks forbore
for they cried fill high the goblet
<|endoftext|>

take this lesson to thy heart
that is best which lieth nearest
shape from that thy work of art
<|endoftext|>

i heard a voice that cried
balder the beautiful
is dead is dead
<|endoftext|>

and through the misty air
passed like the mournful cry
of sunward sailing cranes
<|endoftext|>

i saw the pallid corpse
of the dead sun
borne through the northern sky
<|endoftext|>

blasts from niffelheim
lifted the sheeted mists
around him as he passed
<|endoftext|>

and the voice forever cried
balder the beautiful
is dead is dead
<|endoftext|>

and died away
through the dreary night
in accents of despair
<|endoftext|>

balder the beautiful
god of the summer sun
fairest of all the gods
<|endoftext|>

light from his forehead beamed
runes were upon his tongue
as on the warrior's sword
<|endoftext|>

they laid him in his ship
with horse and harness
as on a funeral pyre
<|endoftext|>

odin placed
a ring upon his finger
and whispered in his ear
<|endoftext|>

but out of the sea of time
rises a new land of song
fairer than the old
<|endoftext|>

build it again
o ye bards
fairer than before
<|endoftext|>

ye fathers of the new race
feed upon morning dew
sing the new song of love
<|endoftext|>

sing no more
o ye bards of the north
of vikings and of jarls
<|endoftext|>

of the days of eld
preserve the freedom only
not the deeds of blood
<|endoftext|>

leaving us heirs to amplest heritages
of all the best thoughts of the greatest sages
and giving tongues unto the silent dead
<|endoftext|>

take them o death
and bear away
whatever thou canst call thine own
<|endoftext|>

our little life is but a gust
that bends the branches of thy tree
and trails its blossoms in the dust
<|endoftext|>

like the beloved john
to lay his head upon the saviour's breast
and thus to journey on
<|endoftext|>

tell us of this nawadaha
i should answer your inquiries
straightway in such words as follow
<|endoftext|>

gitche manito the mighty
the great spirit the creator
smiled upon his helpless children
<|endoftext|>

thus was slain the mishe-mokwa
he the great bear of the mountains
he the terror of the nations
<|endoftext|>

no more work and no more weeping
wahonowin
wahonowin
<|endoftext|>

lulled him into slumber singing
ewa-yea
my little owlet
<|endoftext|>

saw the rainbow in the heaven
in the eastern sky the rainbow
whispered what is that nokomis
<|endoftext|>

sang the robin the opechee
sang the bluebird the owaissa
do not shoot us hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

all the village came and feasted
all the guests praised hiawatha
called him strong-heart soan-ge-taha
<|endoftext|>

welcome
said he hiawatha
to the kingdom of the west-wind
<|endoftext|>

ah kaween
said mudjekeewis
no indeed i will not touch it
<|endoftext|>

hold
at length cried mudjekeewis
hold my son my hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

i have put you to this trial
but to know and prove your courage
now receive the prize of valor
<|endoftext|>

then he smiled and said: to-morrow
is the last day of your conflict
is the last day of your fasting
<|endoftext|>

lazy kwasind
said his mother
in my work you never help me
<|endoftext|>

in the coldest days of winter
i must break the ice for fishing
with my nets you never help me
<|endoftext|>

at the door my nets are hanging
dripping freezing with the water
go and wring them yenadizze
<|endoftext|>

of your strong and pliant branches
my canoe to make more steady
make more strong and firm beneath me
<|endoftext|>

i will make a necklace of them
make a girdle for my beauty
and two stars to deck her bosom
<|endoftext|>

take my bait cried hiawatha
down into the depths beneath him
take my bait o sturgeon nahma
<|endoftext|>

you are ugudwash the sun-fish
you are not the fish i wanted
you are not the king of fishes
<|endoftext|>

then began the greatest battle
that the sun had ever looked on
that the war-birds ever witnessed
<|endoftext|>

thus it was he won the daughter
of the ancient arrow-maker
in the land of the dacotahs
<|endoftext|>

sang the robin the opechee
happy are you laughing water
having such a noble husband
<|endoftext|>

barred with streaks of red and yellow
streaks of blue and bright vermilion
shone the face of pau-puk-keewis
<|endoftext|>

over it the star of evening
melts and trembles through the purple
hangs suspended in the twilight
<|endoftext|>

you shall hear a tale of wonder
hear the story of osseo
son of the evening star osseo
<|endoftext|>

and her lovers the rejected
handsome men with belts of wampum
handsome men with paint and feathers
<|endoftext|>

changed into a weak old woman
with a staff she tottered onward
wasted wrinkled old and ugly
<|endoftext|>

and behold
the earthen kettles
all were changed to bowls of silver
<|endoftext|>

't was no bird he saw before him
't was a beautiful young woman
with the arrow in her bosom
<|endoftext|>

in those days said hiawatha
lo
how all things fade and perish
<|endoftext|>

very crafty very cunning
is the creeping spirit of evil
was the meaning of this symbol
<|endoftext|>

then the figure seated singing
playing on a drum of magic
and the interpretation listen
<|endoftext|>

when i speak the wigwam trembles
shakes the sacred lodge with terror
hands unseen begin to shake it
<|endoftext|>

ay
why do the living said they
lay such heavy burdens on us
<|endoftext|>

i will slay this pau-puk-keewis
slay this mischief-maker
said he
<|endoftext|>

make me large said pau-puk-keewis
make me large and make me larger
larger than the other beavers
<|endoftext|>

here they made him large and larger
made him largest of the beavers
ten times larger than the others
<|endoftext|>

death to kwasind
was the sudden
war-cry of the little people
<|endoftext|>

then he turned and saw the strangers
cowering crouching with the shadows
said within himself who are they
<|endoftext|>

but he questioned not the strangers
only spake to bid them welcome
to his lodge his food his fireside
<|endoftext|>

from the realms of chibiabos
hither have we come to try you
hither have we come to warn you
<|endoftext|>

we are but a burden to you
and we see that the departed
have no place among the living
<|endoftext|>

cried he with his face uplifted
in that bitter hour of anguish
give your children food o father
<|endoftext|>

no my child
said old nokomis
't is the night-wind in the pine-trees
<|endoftext|>

in his lodge beside a river
close beside a frozen river
sat an old man sad and lonely
<|endoftext|>

ah my son
exclaimed the old man
happy are my eyes to see you
<|endoftext|>

at each other looked the warriors
looked the women at each other
smiled and said it cannot be so
<|endoftext|>

from its mouth he said to greet him
came waywassimo the lightning
came the thunder annemeekee
<|endoftext|>

gitche manito the mighty
the great spirit the creator
sends them hither on his errand
<|endoftext|>

i beheld too in that vision
all the secrets of the future
of the distant days that shall be
<|endoftext|>

or the white goose waw-be-wawa
with the water dripping flashing
from its glossy neck and feathers
<|endoftext|>

i am going o nokomis
on a long and distant journey
to the portals of the sunset
<|endoftext|>

and the forests dark and lonely
moved through all their depths of darkness
sighed farewell o hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

and the waves upon the margin
rising rippling on the pebbles
sobbed farewell o hiawatha
<|endoftext|>

thus departed hiawatha
hiawatha the beloved
in the glory of the sunset
<|endoftext|>

the scene of the poem is among the ojibways on the southern shore of
lake superior in the region between the pictured rocks and the
grand sable
<|endoftext|>

thereupon answered john alden but looked not up from his writing
truly the breath of the lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet
he in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon
<|endoftext|>

still the captain continued unheeding the words of the stripling
see how bright they are burnished as if in an arsenal hanging
that is because i have done it myself and not left it to others
<|endoftext|>

green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there
better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people
lest they should count them and see how many already have perished
<|endoftext|>

nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling
busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower
ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing
<|endoftext|>

homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter
letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla
full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla
<|endoftext|>

go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth
say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions
offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier
<|endoftext|>

you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language
such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers
such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden
<|endoftext|>

to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing
as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel
washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean
<|endoftext|>

truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption
rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion
angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan
<|endoftext|>

this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger
for i have followed too much the heart's desires and devices
worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal
<|endoftext|>

had he but spoken then
perhaps not in vain had he spoken
now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished
<|endoftext|>

yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on
so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage
made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth
<|endoftext|>

welcome o wind of the east
he exclaimed in his wild exultation
welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic
<|endoftext|>

fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending
love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding
passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty
<|endoftext|>

still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel
then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom
stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow
<|endoftext|>

better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england
close by my mother's side and among the dust of my kindred
better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor
<|endoftext|>

soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain
sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar
fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders
<|endoftext|>

not far off is the house although the woods are between us
but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming
i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city
<|endoftext|>

but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway
bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance
rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians
<|endoftext|>

straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley
took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron
buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed
<|endoftext|>

alden was left alone
he heard the clank of the scabbard
growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance
<|endoftext|>

god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting
then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation
so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people
<|endoftext|>

but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain
who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing
leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth
<|endoftext|>

silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage
bearing the serpent's skin and seeming himself like a serpent
winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest
<|endoftext|>

just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows
there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth
clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward
<|endoftext|>

standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army
led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men
northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage
<|endoftext|>

giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david
giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible
ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines
<|endoftext|>

over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning
under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing
fired along the line and in regular order retreated
<|endoftext|>

foremost among them was alden
all night he had lain without slumber
turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever
<|endoftext|>

he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council
stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur
sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing
<|endoftext|>

once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence
then he had turned away and said: i will not awake him
let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking
<|endoftext|>

nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale
one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors
seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting
<|endoftext|>

he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish
thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas
thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him
<|endoftext|>

mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them
bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred
seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered
<|endoftext|>

sun-illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean
gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard
buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping
<|endoftext|>

what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless
out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward
be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers
<|endoftext|>

thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort
while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest
looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them
<|endoftext|>

welcome english
they said these words they had learned from the traders
touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries
<|endoftext|>

but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult
all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish
boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples
<|endoftext|>

bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces
waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies
till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations
<|endoftext|>

wooden-barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes
latticed the windows were and the window-panes were of paper
oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded
<|endoftext|>

hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting
then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners
fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden
<|endoftext|>

lo
in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered
bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village
<|endoftext|>

friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also
graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel
one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven
<|endoftext|>

softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal
taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate's presence
after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland
<|endoftext|>

fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth
prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection
speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions
<|endoftext|>

lo
when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold
clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure
<|endoftext|>

but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction
into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement
bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth
<|endoftext|>

i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling
i have been cruel and hard but now thank god
it is ended
<|endoftext|>

then he said with a smile: i should have remembered the adage
if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover
no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas
<|endoftext|>

soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure
friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying
each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted
<|endoftext|>

somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others
placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband
gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey
<|endoftext|>

pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest
pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom
tremulous floating in air o'er the depths of the azure abysses
<|endoftext|>

those sounds that flow
in murmurs of delight and woe
come not from wings of birds
<|endoftext|>

through the cloud-rack dark and trailing
must they see above them sailing
o'er life's barren crags the vulture
<|endoftext|>

what
are these the guests whose glances
seemed like sunshine gleaming round me
<|endoftext|>

these the wild bewildering fancies
that with dithyrambic dances
as with magic circles bound me
<|endoftext|>

spectral gleam their snow-white dresses
and from loose dishevelled tresses
fall the hyacinthine blossoms
<|endoftext|>

o my songs
whose winsome measures
filled my heart with secret rapture
<|endoftext|>

was she a lady of high degree
so much in love with the vanity
and foolish pomp of this world of ours
<|endoftext|>

or was it christian charity
and lowliness and humility
the richest and rarest of all dowers
<|endoftext|>

ah you will then have other cares
in your own short-comings and despairs
in your own secret sins and terrors
<|endoftext|>

adding then by way of jest
golondrina is my guest
'tis the wife of some deserter
<|endoftext|>

the mourners said and death is rest and peace
then added in the certainty of faith
and giveth life that never more shall cease
<|endoftext|>

the groaning earth in travail and in pain
brings forth its races but does not restore
and the dead nations never rise again
<|endoftext|>

its vacant eyes
stare at the skies
stare at the valley green and deep
<|endoftext|>

under the walls of monterey
at daybreak the bugles began to play
victor galbraith
<|endoftext|>

he looked at the earth he looked at the sky
he looked at the files of musketry
victor galbraith
<|endoftext|>

three balls are in his breast and brain
but he rises out of the dust again
victor galbraith
<|endoftext|>

forth dart once more those tongues of flame
and the bugler has died a death of shame
victor galbraith
<|endoftext|>

under the walls of monterey
by night a bugle is heard to play
victor galbraith
<|endoftext|>

and the dead captains as they lay
in their graves o'erlooking the tranquil bay
where they in battle died
<|endoftext|>

and hurried landward far away
crying awake
it is the day
<|endoftext|>

it shouted through the belfry-tower
awake o bell
proclaim the hour
<|endoftext|>

it crossed the churchyard with a sigh
and said not yet
in quiet lie
<|endoftext|>

for his voice i listen and yearn
it is growing late and dark
and my boy does not return
<|endoftext|>

for i hear you at your play
and the questions that perplexed me
have vanished quite away
<|endoftext|>

ah
what would the world be to us
if the children were no more
<|endoftext|>

and whisper in my ear
what the birds and the winds are singing
in your sunny atmosphere
<|endoftext|>

ah me
for the land that is sown
with the harvest of despair
<|endoftext|>

where the burning cinders blown
from the lips of the overthrown
enceladus fill the air
<|endoftext|>

and the storm-wind shouts through the pines
of alps and of apennines
enceladus arise
<|endoftext|>

strike your flag
the rebel cries
in his arrogant old plantation strain
<|endoftext|>

never
our gallant morris replies
it is better to sink than to yield
<|endoftext|>

every waft of the air
was a whisper of prayer
or a dirge for the dead
<|endoftext|>

blow winds
and waft through all the rooms
the snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms
<|endoftext|>

blow winds
and bend within my reach
the fiery blossoms of the peach
<|endoftext|>

o life and love
o happy throng
of thoughts whose only speech is song
<|endoftext|>

o heart of man
canst thou not be
blithe as the air is and as free
<|endoftext|>

a region of repose it seems
a place of slumber and of dreams
remote among the wooded hills
<|endoftext|>

last the musician as he stood
illumined by that fire of wood
fair-haired blue-eyed his aspect blithe
<|endoftext|>

meanwhile impatient to mount and ride
booted and spurred with a heavy stride
on the opposite shore walked paul revere
<|endoftext|>

and lo
as he looks on the belfry's height
a glimmer and then a gleam of light
<|endoftext|>

he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
but lingers and gazes till full on his sight
a second lamp in the belfry burns
<|endoftext|>

thus ariosto says in words
that have the stately stride and ring
of armed knights and clashing swords
<|endoftext|>

beautiful falcon
said he would that i
might hold thee on my wrist or see thee fly
<|endoftext|>

who is thy mother my fair boy
he said
his hand laid softly on that shining head
<|endoftext|>

monna giovanna
will you let me stay
a little while and with your falcon play
<|endoftext|>

rabbi ben levi on the sabbath read
a volume of the law in which it said
no man shall look upon my face and live
<|endoftext|>

and as he read he prayed that god would give
his faithful servant grace with mortal eye
to look upon his face and yet not die
<|endoftext|>

beyond the outer wall the angel of death
heard the great voice and said with panting breath
give back the sword and let me go my way
<|endoftext|>

i am the god thor
i am the war god
i am the thunderer
<|endoftext|>

here in my northland
my fastness and fortress
reign i forever
<|endoftext|>

when at sea with all his rowers
he along the bending oars
outside of his ship could run
<|endoftext|>

he the smalsor horn ascended
and his shining shield suspended
on its summit like a sun
<|endoftext|>

thora of rimol
hide me
hide me
<|endoftext|>

hakon jarl
for the love i bear thee
neither shall shame nor death come near thee
<|endoftext|>

then why dost thou turn so pale o churl
and then again black as the earth
said the earl
<|endoftext|>

and they answered: o queen
if the truth must be told
the ring is of copper and not of gold
<|endoftext|>

why then should i care to have thee
he said
a faded old woman a heathenish jade
<|endoftext|>

half my kingdom would i give
as i live
if by such songs you would earn it
<|endoftext|>

hearken to me then o king
while i sing
the great ocean song that haunts me
<|endoftext|>

then athwart the vapors dun
the easter sun
streamed with one broad track of splendor
<|endoftext|>

in their real forms appeared
the warlocks weird
awful as the witch of endor
<|endoftext|>

sing o scald your song sublime
your ocean-rhyme
cried king olaf: it will cheer me
<|endoftext|>

said the scald with pallid cheeks
the skerry of shrieks
sings too loud for you to hear me
<|endoftext|>

olaf the king one summer morn
blew a blast on his bugle-horn
sending his signal through the land of drontheim
<|endoftext|>

and to the hus-ting held at mere
gathered the farmers far and near
with their war weapons ready to confront him
<|endoftext|>

ploughing under the morning star
old iron-beard in yriar
heard the summons chuckling with a low laugh
<|endoftext|>

he wiped the sweat-drops from his brow
unharnessed his horses from the plough
and clattering came on horseback to king olaf
<|endoftext|>

he was the churliest of the churls
little he cared for king or earls
bitter as home-brewed ale were his foaming passions
<|endoftext|>

hodden-gray was the garb he wore
and by the hammer of thor he swore
he hated the narrow town and all its fashions
<|endoftext|>

but he loved the freedom of his farm
his ale at night by the fireside warm
gudrun his daughter with her flaxen tresses
<|endoftext|>

he loved his horses and his herds
the smell of the earth and the song of birds
his well-filled barns his brook with its water-cresses
<|endoftext|>

huge and cumbersome was his frame
his beard from which he took his name
frosty and fierce like that of hymer the giant
<|endoftext|>

so at the hus-ting he appeared
the farmer of yriar iron-beard
on horseback in an attitude defiant
<|endoftext|>

and to king olaf he cried aloud
out of the middle of the crowd
that tossed about him like a stormy ocean
<|endoftext|>

such sacrifices shalt thou bring
to odin and to thor o king
as other kings have done in their devotion
<|endoftext|>

king olaf answered: i command
this land to be a christian land
here is my bishop who the folk baptizes
<|endoftext|>

but if you ask me to restore
your sacrifices stained with gore
then will i offer human sacrifices
<|endoftext|>

then to their temple strode he in
and loud behind him heard the din
of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting
<|endoftext|>

there in the temple carved in wood
the image of great odin stood
and other gods with thor supreme among them
<|endoftext|>

king olaf smote them with the blade
of his huge war-axe gold inlaid
and downward shattered to the pavement flung them
<|endoftext|>

at the same moment rose without
from the contending crowd a shout
a mingled sound of triumph and of wailing
<|endoftext|>

and there upon the trampled plain
the farmer iron-beard lay slain
midway between the assailed and the assailing
<|endoftext|>

and seeing their leader stark and dead
the people with a murmur said
o king baptize us with thy holy water
<|endoftext|>

so all the drontheim land became
a christian land in name and fame
in the old gods no more believing and trusting
<|endoftext|>

cold will be the dagger's kiss
laden with the chill of death
is its breath
<|endoftext|>

forests have ears and fields have eyes
often treachery lurking lies
underneath the fairest hair
<|endoftext|>

every scald
satires scrawled
on poor thangbrand olaf's priest
<|endoftext|>

o king olaf
little hope
is there of these iceland men
<|endoftext|>

meekly said
with bending head
pious thangbrand olaf's priest
<|endoftext|>

little time have we for speaking
choose between the good and evil
be baptized or thou shalt die
<|endoftext|>

sing me a song divine
with a sword in every line
and this shall be thy reward
<|endoftext|>

and he loosened the belt at his waist
and in front of the singer placed
his sword
<|endoftext|>

but the king said o my son
i miss the bright word in one
of thy measures and thy rhymes
<|endoftext|>

and halfred the scald replied
in another 't was multiplied
three times
<|endoftext|>

and halfred the scald said this
in the name of the lord i kiss
who on it was crucified
<|endoftext|>

and a shout went round the board
in the name of christ the lord
who died
<|endoftext|>

could you not be gone a minute
but some mischief must be doing
turning bad to worse
<|endoftext|>

they who to the saga listened
heard the name of thorberg skafting
for a hundred year
<|endoftext|>

thirty men they each commanded
iron-sinewed horny-handed
shoulders broad and chests expanded
<|endoftext|>

when they landed from the fleet
how they roared through drontheim's street
boisterous as the gale
<|endoftext|>

never saw the wild north sea
such a gallant company
sail its billows blue
<|endoftext|>

the king yes olaf the king
has wedded her with his ring
and thyri is queen in the land
<|endoftext|>

i your pilot will be
for i know all the channels
where flows the deep sea
<|endoftext|>

king olaf laid an arrow on string
have i a coward on board
said he
<|endoftext|>

sullenly answered ulf
the old sea-wolf
you have need of me
<|endoftext|>

what was that
said olaf standing
on the quarter-deck
<|endoftext|>

it is accepted
the angry defiance
the challenge of battle
<|endoftext|>

it is accepted
but not with the weapons
of war that thou wieldest
<|endoftext|>

cross against corselet
love against hatred
peace-cry for war-cry
<|endoftext|>

patience is powerful
he that o'ercometh
hath power o'er the nations
<|endoftext|>

the dawn is not distant
nor is the night starless
love is eternal
<|endoftext|>

god is still god and
his faith shall not fail us
christ is eternal
<|endoftext|>

and all translated in the air
reach me but as our dear lord's prayer
and as the sermon on the mount
<|endoftext|>

o pitiless skies
why did your clouds retain
for peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain
<|endoftext|>

o pitiless earth
why open no abyss
to bury in its chasm a crime like this
<|endoftext|>

then from his house a temple painted white
with fluted columns and a roof of red
the squire came forth august and splendid sight
<|endoftext|>

or a few cherries that are not so sweet
as are the songs these uninvited guests
sing at their feast with comfortable breasts
<|endoftext|>

of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams
as in an idiot's brain remembered words
hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams
<|endoftext|>

and so the dreadful massacre began
o'er fields and orchards and o'er woodland crests
the ceaseless fusillade of terror ran
<|endoftext|>

alone remained the drowsy squire
to rake the embers of the fire
and quench the waning parlor light
<|endoftext|>

this brings a tale into my mind
which if you are not disinclined
to listen i will now relate
<|endoftext|>

or dreaming speak to us and make
a feint of being half awake
and tell us what your dreams may be
<|endoftext|>

and yet on such a dismal day
we need a merrier tale to clear
the dark and heavy atmosphere
<|endoftext|>

below upon the altar-rail
indulgences were set to sale
like ballads at a country fair
<|endoftext|>

then from the pulpit overhead
tetzel the monk with fiery glow
thundered upon the crowd below
<|endoftext|>

count but the gain count not the loss
your gold and silver are but dross
and yet they pave the way to heaven
<|endoftext|>

i hear your mothers and your sires
cry from their purgatorial fires
and will ye not their ransom pay
<|endoftext|>

o senseless people
when the gate
of heaven is open will ye wait
<|endoftext|>

before the winter wore away
her body in the churchyard lay
her patient soul was with the just
<|endoftext|>

and from his pocket with all speed
he drew the priestly title-deed
and prayed the justice he would read
<|endoftext|>

then said he to the priest: i find
this document is duly signed
brother john tetzel his own hand
<|endoftext|>

at all tribunals in the land
in evidence it may be used
therefore acquitted is the accused
<|endoftext|>

mine had a better and the jew's
had none at all that i could see
his aim was only to amuse
<|endoftext|>

it is a certain sign of death
the cabin-boy here held his breath
he felt his blood run cold
<|endoftext|>

i should like to see this ship said he
i should like to find these chimneys three
that are marked down in the chart
<|endoftext|>

o it must be like heaven thought he
those far-off foreign lands to see
and fortune seek and find
<|endoftext|>

her masts were stripped her yards were bare
and on her bowsprit poised in air
sat the klaboterman
<|endoftext|>

the rector paused
the impatient governor cried
this is the lady do you hesitate
<|endoftext|>

lord he thought in heaven that reignest
who am i that thus thou deignest
to reveal thyself to me
<|endoftext|>

who am i that from the centre
of thy glory thou shouldst enter
this poor cell my guest to be
<|endoftext|>

deep distress and hesitation
mingled with his adoration
should he go or should he stay
<|endoftext|>

should he leave the poor to wait
hungry at the convent gate
till the vision passed away
<|endoftext|>

where is the landlord
bring him here
let the lost pleiad reappear
<|endoftext|>

so he came back with downcast head
exclaiming: well our bashful host
hath surely given up the ghost
<|endoftext|>

you must he to the student said
who know so many of the best
and tell them better than the rest
<|endoftext|>

ah me
he turns away and sighs
there is a mist before his eyes
<|endoftext|>

lower and lower on his breast
sinks his gray head he is at rest
no longer he waits for any one
<|endoftext|>

and the baron smiles and says you see
i told you but the simple truth
ah you may trust the eyes of youth
<|endoftext|>

and in course of time the curate learns
a secret so dreadful that by turns
he is ice and fire he freezes and burns
<|endoftext|>

for the sake of the living and the dead
thou shalt be wed as christians wed
and all things come to a happy end
<|endoftext|>

it was not i it was another
did these things unto thee o brother
i only have thee hold thee break thee
<|endoftext|>

the king looked and replied: i know him well
it is the angel men call azrael
't is the death angel what hast thou to fear
<|endoftext|>

and olger answered: when he shall appear
you will behold what manner of man he is
but what will then befall us i know not
<|endoftext|>

his helmet was of iron and his gloves
of iron and his breastplate and his greaves
and tassets were of iron and his shield
<|endoftext|>

the fields and all the roads were filled with iron
and points of iron glistened in the sun
and shed a terror through the city streets
<|endoftext|>

they saw the palace courtyard white with snow
and placid as a nun the moon on high
gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky
<|endoftext|>

come back within the hour
on thy return
the work appointed for thee shalt thou learn
<|endoftext|>

the missing man
ah yes they said
missing but whither had he fled
<|endoftext|>

thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me
wherefore i do not know but strong is the feeling within me
that once more i shall see a face i have never forgotten
<|endoftext|>

then there were voices heard as of two men talking together
and to herself as she listened upbraiding said hannah the housemaid
it is joseph come back and i wonder what stranger is with him
<|endoftext|>

then came the hour of sleep death's counterfeit nightly rehearsal
of the great silent assembly the meeting of shadows where no man
speaketh but all are still and the peace and rest are unbroken
<|endoftext|>

when the lord's work is done and the toil and the labor completed
he hath appointed to me i will gather into the stillness
of my own heart awhile and listen and wait for his guidance
<|endoftext|>

then elizabeth said not troubled nor wounded in spirit
so is it best john estaugh
we will not speak of it further
<|endoftext|>

and on the first-day that followed he rose in the silent assembly
holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little
promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things
<|endoftext|>

lord
how he drank the blood-red country wine
as if the village vintage were divine
<|endoftext|>

good father said he easily we see
how needful in some persons and how right
mortification of the flesh may be
<|endoftext|>

good father the rebellious flesh i see
has changed you back into an ass again
and all my admonitions were in vain
<|endoftext|>

so brother timothy went back once more
to his old life of labor and distress
was beaten worse than he had been before
<|endoftext|>

but this i will not now discuss
i leave the theme that we may thus
remain within the realm of song
<|endoftext|>

the story that i told before
though not acceptable to all
at least you did not find too long
<|endoftext|>

i beg you let me try again
with something in a different vein
before you bid the curtain fall
<|endoftext|>

alas why art thou here
and the army of amurath slain
and left on the battle plain
<|endoftext|>

then again iskander cried
now follow whither i ride
for here thou must not stay
<|endoftext|>

but the sullen scribe replied
our pathways here divide
mine leadeth not thy way
<|endoftext|>

and the pasha bowed his head
and after a silence said
allah is just and great
<|endoftext|>

i yield to the will divine
the city and lands are thine
who shall contend with fate
<|endoftext|>

this simple ballad i retain
clearly imprinted on my brain
and as a tale will now repeat
<|endoftext|>

where are they now
what lands and skies
paint pictures in their friendly eyes
<|endoftext|>

what craft of alchemy can bid defiance
to time and change and for a single hour
renew this phantom-flower
<|endoftext|>

it breathes no more its heart has no pulsation
in the dark places with the dead of old
it lies forever cold
<|endoftext|>

the wrong shall fail
the right prevail
with peace on earth good-will to men
<|endoftext|>

every quivering tongue of flame
seems to murmur some great name
seems to say to me aspire
<|endoftext|>

but the night-wind answers hollow
are the visions that you follow
into darkness sinks your fire
<|endoftext|>

and i make answer: i am satisfied
i dare not ask i know not what is best
god hath already said what shall betide
<|endoftext|>

but fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves
watch the dead christ between the living thieves
and underneath the traitor judas lowers
<|endoftext|>

o bringer of the light whose splendor shines
above the darkness of the apennines
forerunner of the day that is to be
<|endoftext|>

but the statues without breath
that stand on the bridge overarching
the silent river of death
<|endoftext|>

now a stranger looking down
i behold the shadowy crown
of the dark and haunted wood
<|endoftext|>

hermes
much must he toil who serves the immortal gods
and i who am their herald most of all
<|endoftext|>

and thou prometheus say hast thou again
been stealing fire from helios' chariot-wheels
to light thy furnaces
<|endoftext|>

they relent not
they pardon not they are implacable
revengeful unforgiving
<|endoftext|>

no gift of theirs in whatsoever shape
it comes to me with whatsoever charm
to fascinate my sense will i receive
<|endoftext|>

now as an arrow from hyperion's bow
my errand done i fly i float i soar
into the air returning to olympus
<|endoftext|>

with one touch of my swift and winged feet
i spurn the solid earth and leave it rocking
as rocks the bough from which a bird takes wing
<|endoftext|>

surely thou art a goddess for thy voice
is a celestial melody and thy form
self-poised as if it floated on the air
<|endoftext|>

no goddess am i nor of heavenly birth
but a mere woman fashioned out of clay
and mortal as the rest
<|endoftext|>

o what a telltale face thou hast
again
i see the wonder in thy tender eyes
<|endoftext|>

immersed in the fountain
tantalus tastes not
the water that wastes not
<|endoftext|>

yon snow-white cloud that sails sublime in ether
is but the sovereign zeus who like a swan
flies to fair-ankled leda
<|endoftext|>

or perchance
ixion's cloud the shadowy shape of hera
that bore the centaurs
<|endoftext|>

the pipe of pan out of these reeds is made
and when he plays upon it to the shepherds
they pity him so mournful is the sound
<|endoftext|>

assert thyself rise up to thy full height
shake from thy soul these dreams effeminate
these passions born of indolence and ease
<|endoftext|>

forbids
ah me
the secret then is safe
<|endoftext|>

i hesitate no longer
weal or woe
or life or death the moment shall decide
<|endoftext|>

o epimetheus i no longer dare
to lift mine eyes to thine nor hear thy voice
being no longer worthy of thy love
<|endoftext|>

my heart hath braved the oracle that guarded
the fatal secret from us and my hand
lifted the lid of the mysterious chest
<|endoftext|>

only through punishment of our evil deeds
only through suffering are we reconciled
to the immortal gods and to ourselves
<|endoftext|>

never shall souls like these
escape the eumenides
the daughters dark of acheron and night
<|endoftext|>

unquenched our torches glare
our scourges in the air
send forth prophetic sounds before they smite
<|endoftext|>

are these celestial manners
these
the ways that win the arts that please
<|endoftext|>

we are forgotten and in your austere
and calm indifference ye little care
whether we come or go or whence or where
<|endoftext|>

honor and reverence and the good repute
that follows faithful service as its fruit
be unto him whom living we salute
<|endoftext|>

how beautiful is youth
how bright it gleams
with its illusions aspirations dreams
<|endoftext|>

where are the others
voices from the deep
caverns of darkness answer me: they sleep
<|endoftext|>

the scholar and the world
the endless strife
the discord in the harmonies of life
<|endoftext|>

it is too late
ah nothing is too late
till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate
<|endoftext|>

these are indeed exceptions but they show
how far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow
into the arctic regions of our lives
<|endoftext|>

what then
shall we sit idly down and say
the night hath come it is no longer day
<|endoftext|>

around thee would have swarmed the attic bees
homer had been thy friend or socrates
and plato welcomed thee to his demesne
<|endoftext|>

for thee old legends breathed historic breath
thou sawest poseidon in the purple sea
and in the sunset jason's fleece of gold
<|endoftext|>

thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed
i stay a little longer as one stays
to cover up the embers that still burn
<|endoftext|>

an old man in a lodge within a park
the chamber walls depicted all around
with portraitures of huntsman hawk and hound
<|endoftext|>

and ever and anon high over all
uplifted a ninth wave superb and strong
floods all the soul with its melodious seas
<|endoftext|>

forever and forever shalt thou be
to some the gravestone of a dead delight
to some the landmark of a new domain
<|endoftext|>

ah with what subtile meaning did the greek
call thee the lesser mystery at the feast
whereof the greater mystery is death
<|endoftext|>

florence adorns me with her jewelry
and when i think that michael angelo
hath leaned on me i glory in myself
<|endoftext|>

a simple stone with but a date and name
marks his secluded resting-place beside
the river that he loved and glorified
<|endoftext|>

here in the autumn of his days he came
but the dry leaves of life were all aflame
with tints that brightened and were multiplied
<|endoftext|>

o thou whose daily life anticipates
the life to come and in whose thought and word
the spiritual world preponderates
<|endoftext|>

i stand beneath the tree whose branches shade
thy western window chapel of st
john
<|endoftext|>

two kings were they who ruled by right divine
and both supreme one in the realm of truth
one in the realm of fiction and of song
<|endoftext|>

what prince hereditary of their line
uprising in the strength and flush of youth
their glory shall inherit and prolong
<|endoftext|>

not of the howling dervishes of song
who craze the brain with their delirious dance
art thou o sweet historian of the heart
<|endoftext|>

therefore to thee the laurel-leaves belong
to thee our love and our allegiance
for thy allegiance to the poet's art
<|endoftext|>

there is a mountain in the distant west
that sun-defying in its deep ravines
displays a cross of snow upon its side
<|endoftext|>

such is the cross i wear upon my breast
these eighteen years through all the changing scenes
and seasons changeless since the day she died
<|endoftext|>

but the bitterest disgrace
is to see forever the face
of the monk of ephesus
<|endoftext|>

the unconquerable will
this too can bear i still
am belisarius
<|endoftext|>

as men who think to understand
a world by their creator planned
who wiser is than they
<|endoftext|>

thy castle on the crags above
in dust shall crumble and decay
but not the memory of her love
<|endoftext|>

and the mountains dark and high
from their crags re-echoed the cry
of his anger and despair
<|endoftext|>

such was kyrat's wondrous speed
never yet could any steed
reach the dust-cloud in his course
<|endoftext|>

more than maiden more than wife
more than gold and next to life
roushan the robber loved his horse
<|endoftext|>

seven hundred and fourscore
men at arms his livery wore
did his bidding night and day
<|endoftext|>

now through regions all unknown
he was wandering lost alone
seeking without guide his way
<|endoftext|>

o my kyrat o my steed
round and slender as a reed
carry me this peril through
<|endoftext|>

satin housings shall be thine
shoes of gold o kyrat mine
o thou soul of kurroglou
<|endoftext|>

sir i should build me a fortification if i
came to live here
boswell's johnson
<|endoftext|>

his form is the form of a giant
but his face wears an aspect of pain
can this be the laird of inchkenneth
<|endoftext|>

they thought the wise men were men insane
as they spurred their horses across the plain
like riders in haste and who cannot wait
<|endoftext|>

he has heard in the grave the cries
of his people: awake
arise
<|endoftext|>

i say it the white czar
batyushka
gosudar
<|endoftext|>

i swear it i the czar
batyushka
gosudar
<|endoftext|>

here in thy harbors for a while
we lower our sails a while we rest
from the unending endless quest
<|endoftext|>

ah
his hand will nevermore
turn their storied pages o'er
<|endoftext|>

traveller
in what realms afar
in what planet in what star
<|endoftext|>

poet
thou whose latest verse
was a garland on thy hearse
<|endoftext|>

friend
but yesterday the bells
rang for thee their loud farewells
<|endoftext|>

who presented to me on my seventy-second birth-day february
this chair made from the wood of the village blacksmith's
chestnut tree
<|endoftext|>

his presence haunts this room to-night
a form of mingled mist and light
from that far coast
<|endoftext|>

welcome
this vacant chair is thine
dear guest and ghost
<|endoftext|>

what phantom is this that appears
through the purple mist of the years
itself but a mist like these
<|endoftext|>

a woman of cloud and of fire
it is she it is helen of tyre
the town in the midst of the seas
<|endoftext|>

au have vanished but those that moored in the neighboring
roadstead
sailless at anchor ride looming so large in the mist
<|endoftext|>

all is so quiet the troubled breast
the wounded spirit the heart oppressed
here may find the repose it craves
<|endoftext|>

i wash the sands and headlands with my tide
my brow is crowned with branches of the pine
before my chariot-wheels the fishes glide
<|endoftext|>

to lead the year was my appointed place
a mortal dispossessed me by a word
and set there janus with the double face
<|endoftext|>

hark
the sea-faring wild-fowl loud proclaim
my coming and the swarming of the bees
<|endoftext|>

these are my heralds and behold
my name
is written in blossoms on the hawthorn-trees
<|endoftext|>

fair lakes serene and full of light
fair town arrayed in robes of white
how visionary ye appear
<|endoftext|>

all like a floating landscape seems
in cloud-land or the land of dreams
bathed in a golden atmosphere
<|endoftext|>

what is this i read in history
full of marvel full of mystery
difficult to understand
<|endoftext|>

never since the world was made
such a wonderful crusade
started forth for palestine
<|endoftext|>

singing lowly meekly slowly
give us give us back the holy
sepulchre of the redeemer
<|endoftext|>

life and death and love and hate
homes made happy or desolate
hearts made sad or gay
<|endoftext|>

like a red seal is the setting sun
on the good and the evil men have done
naught can to-day restore
<|endoftext|>

through my closed eyelids by the inner sight
i see the constellations in the arc
of their great circles moving on and hark
<|endoftext|>

not in tenderness wanting yet rough are the rhymes of our poet
though it be jacob's voice esau's alas
are the hands
<|endoftext|>

how can the three be one
you ask me i answer by asking
hail and snow and rain are they not three and yet one
<|endoftext|>

and the sea said lo i breathe
but my breath
to some will be life to others death
<|endoftext|>

who has searched or sought
all the unexplored and spacious
universe of thought
<|endoftext|>

how thy name sublime
has descended to this latest
progeny of time
<|endoftext|>

this is our consolation and again
a great soul cries to us in our suspense
i came from martyrdom unto this peace
<|endoftext|>

traveller
why dost thou wildly rush and roar
mad river o mad river
<|endoftext|>

wilt thou not pause and cease to pour
thy hurrying headlong waters o'er
this rocky shelf forever
<|endoftext|>

dost thou not know that what is best
in this too restless world is rest
from over-work and worry
<|endoftext|>

the river
what wouldst thou in these mountains seek
o stranger from the city
<|endoftext|>

is it perhaps some foolish freak
of thine to put the words i speak
into a plaintive ditty
<|endoftext|>

thou seest the day is past its prime
i can no longer waste my time
the mills are tired of waiting
<|endoftext|>

the thoughts of men shall be
as sentinels to keep
your rest from danger free
<|endoftext|>

awake
arise
the hour is late
<|endoftext|>

o traveller stay thy weary feet
drink of this fountain pure and sweet
it flows for rich and poor the same
<|endoftext|>

then go thy way remembering still
the wayside well beneath the hill
the cup of water in his name
<|endoftext|>

what say the bells of san blas
to the ships that southward pass
from the harbor of mazatlan
<|endoftext|>

to them it is nothing more
than the sound of surf on the shore
nothing more to master or man
<|endoftext|>

the saints
ah have they grown
forgetful of their own
<|endoftext|>

o bells of san blas in vain
ye call back the past again
the past is deaf to your prayer
<|endoftext|>

out of the shadows of night
the world rolls into light
it is daybreak everywhere
<|endoftext|>

why dost thou bear me aloft
o angel of god on thy pinions
o'er realms and dominions
<|endoftext|>

softly i float as a cloud
in air for thy right hand upholds me
thy garment enfolds me
<|endoftext|>

sweetest divinest of all
was the humble deed of thine
and the meekness of thy demeanor
<|endoftext|>

angel of light
i cannot gainsay thee
i can but obey thee
<|endoftext|>

but why should the reapers eat of it
and not the prophet of zion
in the den of the lion
<|endoftext|>

alas
how full of fear
is the fate of prophet and seer
<|endoftext|>

let us descend
into the city splendid
into the city of gold
<|endoftext|>

as we draw near
what sound is it i hear
ascending through the dark
<|endoftext|>

repent
repent
repent
<|endoftext|>

o priest and pharisee
who hath warned you to flee
from the wrath that is to be
<|endoftext|>

't is written
man shall not live by bread alone
but by each word that from god's mouth proceedeth
<|endoftext|>

ah could i by some sudden aberration
lend and delude to suicidal death
this christ of nazareth
<|endoftext|>

lo i have brought thee
let thy glory here
be manifest and clear
<|endoftext|>

but one temptation still remains untried
the trial of his pride
the thirst of power the fever of ambition
<|endoftext|>

get thee behind me satan
thou shalt worship
the lord thy god him only shalt thou serve
<|endoftext|>

the nazarene
who preacheth to the poor in field and village
the coming of god's kingdom
<|endoftext|>

how serene
his aspect is
manly yet womanly
<|endoftext|>

and tell me she with eyes of olive tint
and skin as fair as wheat and pale brown hair
the woman at his side
<|endoftext|>

that is manahem
the essenian he who dwells among the palms
near the dead sea
<|endoftext|>

o woman what have i
to do with thee
mine hour is not yet come
<|endoftext|>

all men set forth good wine at the beginning
and when men have well drunk that which is worse
but thou hast kept the good wine until now
<|endoftext|>

hereafter thou shalt see the heavens unclosed
the angels of god ascending and descending
upon the son of man
<|endoftext|>

behold how thy disciples do a thing
which is not lawful on the sabbath-day
and thou forbiddest them not
<|endoftext|>

he hath been with the master
tell us philip
what tidings dost thou bring
<|endoftext|>

as natural brute beasts they growl at things
they do not understand and they shall perish
utterly perish in their own corruption
<|endoftext|>

wells are they without water
clouds carried with a tempest unto whom
the mist of darkness is reserved forever
<|endoftext|>

behold he cometh
there is one man with him
i am amazed to see
<|endoftext|>

i feel that it might say unto the blind
receive your sight
and straightway they would see
<|endoftext|>

i feel that it might say unto the dead
arise
and they would hear it and obey
<|endoftext|>

what have i to do
with thee thou son of god
do not torment us
<|endoftext|>

go home unto thy friends
and tell them how great things the lord hath done
for thee and how he had compassion on thee
<|endoftext|>

the herds
the herd
o most unlucky day
<|endoftext|>

thus righteously are punished
the apostate jews that eat the flesh of swine
and broth of such abominable things
<|endoftext|>

we sacrifice a sow unto demeter
at the beginning of harvest and another
to dionysus at the vintage-time
<|endoftext|>

let us depart
for they that sanctify and purify
themselves in gardens eating flesh of swine
<|endoftext|>

o master
i entreat thee
i implore thee
<|endoftext|>

my daughter lieth at the point of death
i pray thee come and lay thy hands upon her
and she shall live
<|endoftext|>

thou seest the multitude that throng and press thee
and sayest thou: who touched me
't was not i
<|endoftext|>

see she obeys his voice
she stirs
she lives
<|endoftext|>

and pass and disappear and are no more
but leave behind their merchandise and jewels
their perfumes and their gold and their disgust
<|endoftext|>

i loathe them and the very memory of them
is unto me as thought of food to one
cloyed with the luscious figs of dalmanutha
<|endoftext|>

i look upon this raiment that i wear
these silks and these embroideries and they seem
only as cerements wrapped about my limbs
<|endoftext|>

i look upon these rings thick set with pearls
and emerald and amethyst and jasper
and they are burning coals upon my flesh
<|endoftext|>

but from that very hour the seven demons
that had their habitation in this body
which men call beautiful departed from me
<|endoftext|>

as of a drowning man
and then the voice
why didst thou doubt o thou of little faith
<|endoftext|>

whereunto shall i liken then the men
of this generation
and what are they like
<|endoftext|>

see how she kneels there weeping and her tears
fall on his feet and her long golden hair
waves to and fro and wipes them dry again
<|endoftext|>

a certain creditor
had once two debtors and the one of them
owed him five hundred pence the other fifty
<|endoftext|>

yea for i said to thee
it shall be well with thee if thou love justice
and clemency towards thy fellow-men
<|endoftext|>

and then foreseeing all thy life i added
but these thou wilt forget and at the end
of life the lord will punish thee
<|endoftext|>

thou shalt reign twenty
nay thirty years
i cannot name the end
<|endoftext|>

this is my birthday and a happier one
was never mine
we hold a banquet here
<|endoftext|>

that they may be inhabitants of earth
and lead man to destruction
such are these
<|endoftext|>

not that dear child
i dare not for the people
regard john as a prophet
<|endoftext|>

good manahem
give me thy hand
i love the essenians
<|endoftext|>

he's gone and hears me not
the guests are dumb
awaiting the pale face the silent witness
<|endoftext|>

sink back into the earth
or vanish into the air
thou castle of despair
<|endoftext|>

let it all be but a dream
of the things of monstrous birth
of the things that only seem
<|endoftext|>

the lamps are all extinguished only one
burns steadily and from the door its light
lies like a shining gate across the street
<|endoftext|>

verily verily i say unto thee
except a man be born again he cannot
behold the kingdom of god
<|endoftext|>

verily i say unto thee except
a man be born of water and the spirit
he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
<|endoftext|>

we israelites from the primeval man
adam ahelion derive our bodies
our souls are breathings of the holy ghost
<|endoftext|>

it is not this the jews are waiting for
nor can this be the christ the son of david
who shall deliver us
<|endoftext|>

and no man hath ascended up to heaven
but he alone that first came down from heaven
even the son of man which is in heaven
<|endoftext|>

this is the condemnation that the light
is come into the world and men loved darkness
rather than light because their deeds are evil
<|endoftext|>

of me he speaketh
he reproveth me
because i come by night to question him
<|endoftext|>

but he that doeth truth comes to the light
so that his deeds may be made manifest
that they are wrought in god
<|endoftext|>

a young man clad in white
is coming through the gateway and a crowd
of people follow
<|endoftext|>

chilion
good neighbors
lead me on
<|endoftext|>

good lord
my sight
that i receive my sight
<|endoftext|>

how beautiful thou art
i should have known thee
thou hast her eyes whom we shall see hereafter
<|endoftext|>

o god of abraham
elion
adonai
<|endoftext|>

how can it be that thou
being a jew askest to drink of me
which am a woman of samaria
<|endoftext|>

sir thou hast naught to draw with and the well
is deep
whence hast thou living water
<|endoftext|>

say art thou greater than our father jacob
which gave this well to us and drank thereof
himself and all his children and his cattle
<|endoftext|>

some say
that thou art john the baptist some elias
and others jeremiah
<|endoftext|>

for wherein shall a man be profited
if he shall gain the whole world and shall lose
himself or be a castaway
<|endoftext|>

lo
this is my beloved son
hear him
<|endoftext|>

it is the voice of god
he speaketh to us
as from the burning bush he spake to moses
<|endoftext|>

again he speaks of it
what can it mean
this rising from the dead
<|endoftext|>

he is mine only child a lunatic
and sorely vexed for oftentimes he falleth
into the fire and oft into the water
<|endoftext|>

dumb and deaf spirit
come out of him i charge thee and no more
enter thou into him
<|endoftext|>

how motionless
he lieth there
no life is left in him
<|endoftext|>

behold
the master stoops
and takes him by the hand and lifts him up
<|endoftext|>

from my youth up
all these things have i kept
what lack i yet
<|endoftext|>

with what divine compassion in his eyes
the master looks upon this eager youth
as if he loved him
<|endoftext|>

children
how hard it is for them that trust
in riches to enter into the kingdom of god
<|endoftext|>

't is easier for a camel to go through
a needle's eye than for the rich to enter
the kingdom of god
<|endoftext|>

only to be with thee only to see thee
sufficeth me
my heart is then at rest
<|endoftext|>

martha martha
careful and troubled about many things
art thou and yet one thing alone is needful
<|endoftext|>

it is not he but like him for that beggar
was blind from birth
it cannot be the same
<|endoftext|>

a man that is called jesus made a clay
and put it on mine eyes and said to me
go to siloam's pool and wash thyself
<|endoftext|>

what is this crowd
gathered about a beggar
what has happened
<|endoftext|>

the sabbath day
this man is not of god
because he keepeth not the sabbath day
<|endoftext|>

whether he be a sinner i know not
one thing i know that whereas i was blind
i now do see
<|endoftext|>

inventions
of abriman the spirit of the dark
the evil spirit
<|endoftext|>

i regret the gossip
of friends and neighbors at the open door
on summer nights
<|endoftext|>

but the dishonor helen
let the ships
of tarshish howl for that
<|endoftext|>

wake helen from thy sleep
the air grows cold
let us go down
<|endoftext|>

he is at nazareth he is at nain
or at the lovely village on the lake
or sailing on its waters
<|endoftext|>

and his disciples said beseeching him
send her away
she crieth after us
<|endoftext|>

perhaps thou wilt for i have brought thee here
to keep the holy passover and lay
thine offering of thanksgiving on the altar
<|endoftext|>

a great multitude of people
fills all the street and riding on an ass
comes one of noble aspect like a king
<|endoftext|>

what sweetness what compassion
i no longer
wonder that he hath healed me
<|endoftext|>

but i have seen him and have heard his voice
and i am satisfied
i ask no more
<|endoftext|>

it is that loud and turbulent galilean
that came here at the feast of dedication
and stirred the people up to break the law
<|endoftext|>

o rabban simeon
how must thy bones
stir in their grave to hear such blasphemies
<|endoftext|>

o master
though all men shall be offended
because of thee yet will not i be
<|endoftext|>

simon
behold how satan hath desired to have you
that he may sift you as one sifteth wheat
<|endoftext|>

wherefore can i not follow thee
i am ready
to go with thee to prison and to death
<|endoftext|>

my spirit is exceeding sorrowful
even unto death
tarry ye here and watch
<|endoftext|>

under this ancient olive-tree that spreads
its broad centennial branches like a tent
let us lie down and rest
<|endoftext|>

it is for sorrow that our eyes are heavy
i see again the glimmer of those torches
among the olives they are coming hither
<|endoftext|>

beloved master
alas
we know not what to answer thee
<|endoftext|>

it is enough
behold the son of man
hath been betrayed into the hands of sinners
<|endoftext|>

the hour is come
rise up let us be going
for he that shall betray me is at hand
<|endoftext|>

ah me
see from his forehead in the torchlight
great drops of blood are falling to the ground
<|endoftext|>

what lights are these
what torches glare and glisten
upon the swords and armor of these men
<|endoftext|>

what do we
clearly something must we do
for this man worketh many miracles
<|endoftext|>

i am informed that he is a mechanic
a carpenter's son a galilean peasant
keeping disreputable company
<|endoftext|>

the people say that here in bethany
he hath raised up a certain lazarus
who had been dead three days
<|endoftext|>

now surely thou art also one of them
thou art a galilean and thy speech
betrayeth thee
<|endoftext|>

who art thou
tell us plainly of thyself
and of thy doctrines and of thy disciples
<|endoftext|>

if i have spoken evil
bear witness of the evil but if well
why smitest thou me
<|endoftext|>

hereafter shall ye see the son of man
sit on the right hand of the power of god
and come in clouds of heaven
<|endoftext|>

how couldst thou see me
i swear unto thee
i do not know this man of whom ye speak
<|endoftext|>

ye have a god who seemeth like yourselves
incomprehensible dwelling apart
majestic cloud-encompassed clothed in darkness
<|endoftext|>

i was once to say it in brief
a highwayman a robber-chief
in the open light of day
<|endoftext|>

so much i am free to confess
but all men more or less
are robbers in their way
<|endoftext|>

what think ye would he care
for a jew slain here or there
or a plundered caravan
<|endoftext|>

therefore was herod wroth
with matthias margaloth
and burned him for a show
<|endoftext|>

therefore his wrath did smite
judas the gaulonite
and his followers as ye know
<|endoftext|>

already those women of mine
are mixing the myrrh and the wine
i shall not be with you long
<|endoftext|>

put on thy royal robes put on thy crown
and take thy sceptre
hail thou king of the jews
<|endoftext|>

i bring him forth to you that ye may know
i find no fault in him
behold the man
<|endoftext|>

we have a law
and by our law he ought to die because
he made himself to be the son of god
<|endoftext|>

ah
there are sons of god and demigods
more than ye know ye ignorant high-priests
<|endoftext|>

dost thou not answer me
dost thou not know
that i have power enough to crucify thee
<|endoftext|>

here take ye this inscription priests and nail it
upon the cross above your victim's head
jesus of nazareth king of the jews
<|endoftext|>

it stung me into madness
how i loved
yet hated him: but in the other world
<|endoftext|>

i will be there before him and will wait
until he comes and fall down on my knees
and kiss his feet imploring pardon pardon
<|endoftext|>

that shall not be forgiven in this world
nor in the world to come
is that my sin
<|endoftext|>

have i offended so there is no hope
here nor hereafter
that i soon shall know
<|endoftext|>

those hands that healed the sick now pierced with nails
those feet that wandered homeless through the world
now crossed and bleeding and at rest forever
<|endoftext|>

thou that destroyest the temple and dost build it
in three days save thyself and if thou be
the son of god come down now from the cross
<|endoftext|>

in god he trusted
let him deliver him if he will have him
and we will then believe
<|endoftext|>

father
forgive them
they know not what they do
<|endoftext|>

golgotha
golgotha
oh the pain and darkness
<|endoftext|>

oh the uplifted cross that shall forever
shine through the darkness and shall conquer pain
by the triumphant memory of this hour
<|endoftext|>

but go your way and say to his disciples
he goeth before you into galilee
there shall ye see him as he said to you
<|endoftext|>

we have come back again
to the old life the peaceful life among
the white towns of the galilean lake
<|endoftext|>

't is like an apparition
he hath kindled
a fire of coals and seems to wait for us
<|endoftext|>

how that reminds me of the days gone by
and one who said: launch out into the deep
and cast your nets
<|endoftext|>

lo
we again have found thee
leave us not
<|endoftext|>

how more than we do
he remaineth ever
self-confident and boastful as before
<|endoftext|>

will follow thee through fasting and temptation
through all thine agony and bloody sweat
thy cross and passion even unto death
<|endoftext|>

bartholomew
he ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of god
the father almighty
<|endoftext|>

the fear of god is in his book
the pages of the pentateuch
are full of the terror of his name
<|endoftext|>

then reigned the son his covenant
was peace on earth good-will to man
with him the reign of law began
<|endoftext|>

already the whole land is white
with convent walls as if by night
a snow had fallen on hill and height
<|endoftext|>

founder of convents in the west
who built on mount cassino's crest
in the land of labor thine eagle's nest
<|endoftext|>

from its station drag the ponderous
cross of iron that to mock us
is uplifted high in air
<|endoftext|>

seize the loud vociferous bells and
clashing clanging to the pavement
hurl them from their windy tower
<|endoftext|>

aim your lightnings
at the oaken
massive iron-studded portals
<|endoftext|>

a chamber in a tower
prince henry sitting alone ill and
restless
<|endoftext|>

that like o'erflowing streamlets started
and now are dwindled one by one
to stony channels in the sun
<|endoftext|>

rest
rest
oh give me rest and peace
<|endoftext|>

the thought of life that ne'er shall cease
has something in it like despair
a weight i am too weak to bear
<|endoftext|>

and it is not a matter of special wonder
that when god is walking overhead
you should not hear my feeble tread
<|endoftext|>

my being here is accidental
the storm that against your casement drives
in the little village below waylaid me
<|endoftext|>

and there i heard with a secret delight
of your maladies physical and mental
which neither astonished nor dismayed me
<|endoftext|>

ay whole schools
of doctors with their learned rules
but the case is quite beyond their science
<|endoftext|>

woe
woe
eternal woe
<|endoftext|>

this o brave physician
this
is thy great palingenesis
<|endoftext|>

golden visions wave and hover
golden vapors waters streaming
landscapes moving changing gleaming
<|endoftext|>

what ho
that merry sudden blast
reminds me of the days long past
<|endoftext|>

no banner flying from the walls
no pages and no seneschals
no warders and one porter only
<|endoftext|>

no if you please
a strange mysterious disease
fell on him with a sudden blight
<|endoftext|>

oh horrible fate
outcast rejected
as one with pestilence infected
<|endoftext|>

still in my soul that cry goes on
forever gone
forever gone
<|endoftext|>

ah what a cruel sense of loss
like a black shadow would fall across
the hearts of all if he should die
<|endoftext|>

the day is done and slowly from the scene
the stooping sun up-gathers his spent shafts
and puts them back into his golden quiver
<|endoftext|>

yes there it flows forever broad and still
as when the vanguard of the roman legions
first saw it from the top of yonder hill
<|endoftext|>

a stranger and alone
among that brotherhood
the monk felix stood
<|endoftext|>

it was as if i dreamed
for what to me had seemed
moments only had been hours
<|endoftext|>

upon thy forehead he will place
not his crown of thorns
but a crown of roses
<|endoftext|>

in his room overhead
i heard him walking across the floor
as he always does with a heavy tread
<|endoftext|>

poor prince alas
and yet as mild
and patient as the gentlest child
<|endoftext|>

no not the stork by god in heaven
as a blessing the dear white stork was given
but the prince has given us all the rest
<|endoftext|>

yes if the dear god does not take
pity upon him in his distress
and work a miracle
<|endoftext|>

i am glad he is dead
it will be a warning
to the wolves in the forest far and wide
<|endoftext|>

see how she nods her heavy head
and her sleepy feet are so unsteady
she will hardly be able to creep upstairs
<|endoftext|>

for she has visions and strange dreams
and in all her words and ways she seems
much older than she is in truth
<|endoftext|>

i am disturbed and much distressed
in thinking our dear prince must die
i cannot close mine eyes nor rest
<|endoftext|>

what dost thou mean
my child
my child
<|endoftext|>

that for our dear prince henry's sake
i will myself the offering make
and give my life to purchase his
<|endoftext|>

i saw our little gertrude die
she left off breathing and no more
i smoothed the pillow beneath her head
<|endoftext|>

my child
my child
thou must not die
<|endoftext|>

why should i live
do i not know
the life of woman is full of woe
<|endoftext|>

i cannot rest until my sight
is satisfied with seeing thee
what then if thou wert dead
<|endoftext|>

whether it be a dark temptation
of the evil one or god's inspiration
we in our blindness cannot say
<|endoftext|>

i almost shuddered at her kiss
as if a ghost had touched my cheek
i am so childish and so weak
<|endoftext|>

go sin no more
thy penance o'er
a new and better life begin
<|endoftext|>

o blessed lord
how much i need
thy light to guide me on my way
<|endoftext|>

what wrong repressed what right maintained
what struggle passed what victory gained
what good attempted and attained
<|endoftext|>

the poor in body and estate
the sick and the disconsolate
must not on man's convenience wait
<|endoftext|>

god was my foster
he fostered me
under the book of the palm-tree
<|endoftext|>

i wonder that any man has the face
to call such a hole the house of the lord
and the gate of heaven yet such is the word
<|endoftext|>

he comes
in the twilight he will not see
the difference between his priest and me
<|endoftext|>

remorseful penitent and lowly
i come to crave o father holy
thy benediction on my head
<|endoftext|>

thou art a prince
if thou shouldst die
what hearts and hopes would prostrate lie
<|endoftext|>

with thee a noble name expires
and vanishes from the earth's face
the glorious memory of thy sires
<|endoftext|>

if justice rules the universe
from the good actions of good men
angels of light should be begotten
<|endoftext|>

noble art thou in thy birth
by the good and the great of earth
hast thou been taught
<|endoftext|>

the mother's heart resists no longer
with the angel of the lord in vain
it wrestled for he was the stronger
<|endoftext|>

my life is little
only a cup of water
but pure and limpid
<|endoftext|>

it is given willingly
it is given freely
may god bless the gift
<|endoftext|>

thy words fall from thy lips
like roses from the lips of angelo: and angels
might stoop to pick them up
<|endoftext|>

sleepless and restless i alone
in the dusk and damp of these walls of stone
wander and weep in my remorse
<|endoftext|>

they rise up and their garments wave
dimly and spectral as they rise
with the light of another world in their eyes
<|endoftext|>

wake not beloved
be thy sleep
silent as night is and as deep
<|endoftext|>

friend
can you tell me where alight
thuringia's horsemen for the night
<|endoftext|>

my hopes are high my heart is proud
and like a trumpet long and loud
thither my thoughts all clang and ring
<|endoftext|>

our journey into italy
perchance together we may make
wilt thou not do it for my sake
<|endoftext|>

what ho
good people
do you not hear
<|endoftext|>

dashing along at the top of his speed
booted and spurred on his jaded steed
a courier comes with words of cheer
<|endoftext|>

christ is arisen
whence come you
from court
<|endoftext|>

christ is arisen
whence come you
from town
<|endoftext|>

and here comes a third who is spurring amain
what news do you bring with your loose-hanging rein
your spurs wet with blood and your bridle with foam
<|endoftext|>

christ is arisen
whence come you
from rome
<|endoftext|>

but hark
the bells are beginning to chime
and i feel that i am growing hoarse
<|endoftext|>

and the wheel wherewith it is swayed and rung
is the mind of man that round and round
sways and maketh the tongue to sound
<|endoftext|>

such columns and such arches and such windows
so many tombs and statues in the chapels
and under them so many confessionals
<|endoftext|>

they must be for the rich
i should not like
to tell my sins in such a church as this
<|endoftext|>

a great master of his craft
erwin von steinbach but not he alone
for many generations labored with him
<|endoftext|>

see too the rose above the western portal
resplendent with a thousand gorgeous colors
the perfect flower of gothic loveliness
<|endoftext|>

when in the garden placed by thee
the fruit of the forbidden tree
he ate and he must die
<|endoftext|>

it can by thee alone be done
by thee the victory shall be won
o'er satan and the fall
<|endoftext|>

here the angel gabriel shall leave paradise and fly towards the
earth the jaws of hell open below and the devils walk about
making a great noise
<|endoftext|>

the angels of the planets seven
across the shining fields of heaven
the natal star we bring
<|endoftext|>

dropping our sevenfold virtues down
as priceless jewels in the crown
of christ our new-born king
<|endoftext|>

i am the angel of the moon
darkened to be rekindled soon
beneath the azure cope
<|endoftext|>

nearest to earth it is my ray
that best illumes the midnight way
i bring the gift of hope
<|endoftext|>

he is the high priest of the dove
and sends from his great throne above
justice that shall atone
<|endoftext|>

the planet mercury whose place
is nearest to the sun in space
is my allotted sphere
<|endoftext|>

and with celestial ardor swift
i hear upon my hands the gift
of heavenly prudence here
<|endoftext|>

though in a manger thou draw breath
thou art greater than life and death
greater than joy or woe
<|endoftext|>

though humbly born in bethlehem
a sceptre and a diadem
await thy brow and hand
<|endoftext|>

hark
how the robins shout and sing
as if to hail their infant king
<|endoftext|>

what ho
i fain would drink a can
of the strong wine of canaan
<|endoftext|>

may maledictions fall and blast
thyself and lineage to the last
of all thy kith and kin
<|endoftext|>

would i were dead
would i were dead
and buried in the ground
<|endoftext|>

see how the stream has overflowed
its banks and o'er the meadow road
is spreading far and wide
<|endoftext|>

now will i make them sing and soar
so far they shall return no more
unto this river's brink
<|endoftext|>

fly fly
ye sparrows
you are free
<|endoftext|>

thou art a sorcerer i know
oft has my mother told me so
i will not play with thee
<|endoftext|>

ye wicked boys
why do ye play
and break the holy sabbath day
<|endoftext|>

come hither judas iscariot
say if thy lesson thou hast got
from the rabbinical book or not
<|endoftext|>

now little jesus the carpenter's son
let us see how thy task is done
canst thou thy letters say
<|endoftext|>

with fragrant flowers thy head is crowned
while like a guard we stand around
and hail thee as our king
<|endoftext|>

nor let the passers-by refuse
to bring that homage which men use
to majesty to bring
<|endoftext|>

at the close of which we shall accord
by way of benison and reward
the sight of a holy martyr's bones
<|endoftext|>

in its veins the blood is hot and red
and a heart still beats in those ribs of oak
that time may have tamed but has not broke
<|endoftext|>

in particular wurzburg well may boast
of its blessed wine of the holy ghost
which of all wines i like the most
<|endoftext|>

what a delicious fragrance springs
from the deep flagon while it fills
as of hyacinths and daffodils
<|endoftext|>

it is growing dark
yet one line more
and then my work for to-day is o'er
<|endoftext|>

it has a very awful look
as it stands there at the end of the book
like the sun in an eclipse
<|endoftext|>

the dusty road is brown with rain
and speeding on with might and main
hitherward rides a gallant train
<|endoftext|>

what a fair lady
and beside her
what a handsome graceful noble rider
<|endoftext|>

can it be so
or does my sight
deceive me in the uncertain light
<|endoftext|>

it is count hugo of the rhine
the deadliest foe of all our race
and hateful unto me and mine
<|endoftext|>

i know you and i see the scar
the brand upon your forehead shine
and redden like a baleful star
<|endoftext|>

count hugo once but now the wreck
of what i was
o hoheneck
<|endoftext|>

then suddenly from the dark there came
a voice that called me by my name
and said to me kneel down and pray
<|endoftext|>

have known me in that earlier time
a man of violence and crime
whose passions brooked no curb nor check
<|endoftext|>

yes lift your princely hand and take
revenge if 't is revenge you seek
then pardon me for jesus' sake
<|endoftext|>

but now our souls are more subdued
the hand of god and not in vain
has touched us with the fire of pain
<|endoftext|>

let us kneel down and side by side
pray till our souls are purified
and pardon will not be denied
<|endoftext|>

no danger
to-night he will let us alone
as i happen to know he has guests of his own
<|endoftext|>

well then since you are in the mood
to give your noisy humors vent
sing and howl to your heart's content
<|endoftext|>

what is the name of yonder friar
with an eye that glows like a coal of fire
and such a black mass of tangled hair
<|endoftext|>

he's a stranger
you had better ask his name
and where he is going and whence he came
<|endoftext|>

you must know then it is in the diocese
called the diocese of vannes
in the province of brittany
<|endoftext|>

ha
that is a convent
that is an abbey
<|endoftext|>

and then all day
up and away
through the forest hunting the deer
<|endoftext|>

ah my friends i'm afraid that here
you are a little too pious a little too tame
and the more is the shame
<|endoftext|>

't is the greatest folly
not to be jolly
that's what i think
<|endoftext|>

for some of us knew a thing or two
in the abbey of st
gildas de rhuys
<|endoftext|>

for instance the great ado
with old fulbert's niece
the young and lovely heloise
<|endoftext|>

what is that bell for
are you such asses
as to keep up the fashion of midnight masses
<|endoftext|>

a spy in the convent
one of the brothers
telling scandalous tales of the others
<|endoftext|>

do you brother paul
creep under the window close to the wall
and open it suddenly when i call
<|endoftext|>

then seize the villain by the hair
and hold him there
and punish him soundly once for all
<|endoftext|>

as saint dunstan of old
we are told
once caught the devil by the nose
<|endoftext|>

help
help
are you going to slay me
<|endoftext|>

and such am i
my soul within
was dark with passion and soiled with sin
<|endoftext|>

many a wandering suabian bard
whose life was dreary and bleak and hard
has found through me the way to fame
<|endoftext|>

it was a dream and would not stay
a dream that in a single night
faded and vanished out of sight
<|endoftext|>

no other words than these he said
but they were like a funeral wail
my life was ended my heart was dead
<|endoftext|>

and i thanked god in my fever and pain
that those shadows on the midnight plain
were gone and could not come again
<|endoftext|>

i left my father's home to come
like catherine to her martyrdom
for blindly i esteemed it so
<|endoftext|>

and when i heard the convent door
behind me close to ope no more
i felt it smite me like a blow
<|endoftext|>

i felt the agony decrease
by slow degrees then wholly cease
ending in perfect rest and peace
<|endoftext|>

the path that runs through the fairest meads
on the sunniest side of the valley leads
into a region bleak and sterile
<|endoftext|>

ah what a pity 't is that she should listen
unto such songs when in her orisons
she might have heard in heaven the angels singing
<|endoftext|>

and here the heart of the new-wedded wife
coming from church with her beloved lord
he startles with the rattle of his drum
<|endoftext|>

for the reason
that life and all that speaks of life is lovely
and death and all that speaks of death is hateful
<|endoftext|>

ha
ha
perdition
<|endoftext|>

ha
ha
defeated
<|endoftext|>

how bleak and bare it is
nothing but mosses
grow on these rocks
<|endoftext|>

how beautiful it is
it seems a garden
of paradise
<|endoftext|>

the days are short the way before us long
we must not linger if we think to reach
the inn at belinzona before vespers
<|endoftext|>

ho barbarossa
how thy mottled haunches
sweat with this canter over hill and glade
<|endoftext|>

hark
what sweet sounds are those whose accents holy
fill the warm noon with music sad and sweet
<|endoftext|>

but by what instinct or what secret sign
meeting me here do you straightway divine
that northward of the alps my country lies
<|endoftext|>

your accent like st
peter's would betray you
did not your yellow beard and your blue eyes
<|endoftext|>

moreover we have seen your face before
and heard you preach at the cathedral door
on easter sunday in the strasburg square
<|endoftext|>

it is the sea it is the sea
in all its vague immensity
fading and darkening in the distance
<|endoftext|>

upon a sea more vast and dark
the spirits of the dead embark
all voyaging to unknown coasts
<|endoftext|>

we wave our farewells from the shore
and they depart and come no more
or come as phantoms and as ghosts
<|endoftext|>

the sea is silent the sea is discreet
deep it lies at thy very feet
there is no confessor like unto death
<|endoftext|>

the fisherman who lies afloat
with shadowy sail in yonder boat
is singing softly to the night
<|endoftext|>

but do i comprehend aright
the meaning of the words he sung
so sweetly in his native tongue
<|endoftext|>

angel of god
thy finer sense perceives
celestial and perpetual harmonies
<|endoftext|>

all this morning until noon
we had baffling winds and sudden flaws
struck the sea with their cat's-paws
<|endoftext|>

do you see that livornese felucca
that vessel to the windward yonder
running with her gunwale under
<|endoftext|>

one hundred and twenty-five propositions
which i will maintain with the sword of the tongue
against all disputants old and young
<|endoftext|>

let us see if doctors or dialecticians
will dare to dispute my definitions
or attack any one of my learned theses
<|endoftext|>

and therein he contradicteth himself
for he opens the whole discussion by stating
that god can only exist in creating
<|endoftext|>

so much at least i am bound to acknowledge
the air seems healthy the buildings stately
and on the whole i like it greatly
<|endoftext|>

the first three years of the college course
are given to logic alone as the source
of all that is noble and wise and true
<|endoftext|>

that seems rather strange i must confess
in a medical school yet nevertheless
you doubtless have reasons for that
<|endoftext|>

the challenge of some scholastic wight
who wishes to hold a public debate
on sundry questions wrong or right
<|endoftext|>

so long as the boastful human mind
consents in such mills as this to grind
i sit very firmly upon my throne
<|endoftext|>

against all opposition
against all prayers entreaties protestations
she will not be persuaded
<|endoftext|>

not one step further
for i only meant
to put thus far thy courage to the proof
<|endoftext|>

it is enough
i too have strength to die
for thou hast taught me
<|endoftext|>

the rest is yours
why wait you
i am ready
<|endoftext|>

then start not at the creaking of the door
through which i pass
i see what lies beyond it
<|endoftext|>

and you o prince
bear back my benison
unto my father's house and all within it
<|endoftext|>

this morning in the church i prayed for them
after confession after absolution
when my whole soul was white i prayed for them
<|endoftext|>

and in your life let my remembrance linger
as something not to trouble and disturb it
but to complete it adding life to life
<|endoftext|>

perhaps it is a mercy of god
lest the dead there under the sod
in the land of strangers should be lonely
<|endoftext|>

god help us
i hope we have done right
we thought we were acting for the best
<|endoftext|>

alas
i am simple and lowly bred
i am poor distracted and forlorn
<|endoftext|>

they call her the lady alicia now
for the prince in salerno made a vow
that elsie only would he wed
<|endoftext|>

as fair and lovely did she seem
as in a story or a dream
some beautiful and foreign lady
<|endoftext|>

we shall behold our child once more
she is not dead
she is not dead
<|endoftext|>

god listening must have overheard
the prayers that without sound or word
our hearts in secrecy have said
<|endoftext|>

the forest behind and the garden before
and midway an old man of threescore
with a wife and children that caress him
<|endoftext|>

they are the bells of geisenheim
that with their melancholy chime
ring out the curfew of the sun
<|endoftext|>

their voices only speak to me
of peace and deep tranquillity
and endless confidence in thee
<|endoftext|>

o power of meekness
whose very gentleness and weakness
are like the yielding but irresistible air
<|endoftext|>

oh yes a tower of strength indeed
a present help in all our need
a sword and buckler is our god
<|endoftext|>

yea music is the prophet's art
among the gifts that god hath sent
one of the most magnificent
<|endoftext|>

enough i have had of hunting hares
enough of these hours of idle mirth
enough of nets and traps and gins
<|endoftext|>

behold
a hand unbars the door
ye shall be captives held no more
<|endoftext|>

why touch upon such themes
perhaps some friend
may ask incredulous and to what good end
<|endoftext|>

st
paul commands all women to keep silence
within the churches
<|endoftext|>

thou canst not answer
it is for the priest
and against this i bear my testimony
<|endoftext|>

the hand that cut
the red cross from the colors of the king
can cut the red heart from this heresy
<|endoftext|>

to-night they sleep in prison
if they die
they cannot say that we have caused their death
<|endoftext|>

we do but guard the passage with the sword
pointed towards them if they dash upon it
their blood will be on their own heads not ours
<|endoftext|>

o day of rest
how beautiful how fair
how welcome to the weary and the old
<|endoftext|>

ah why will man by his austerities
shut out the blessed sunshine and the light
and make of thee a dungeon of despair
<|endoftext|>

all silent as a graveyard
no one stirring
no footfall in the street no sound of voices
<|endoftext|>

the women screamed and fainted and the boys
made such an uproar in the gallery
i could not keep them quiet
<|endoftext|>

and when she died priest wilson threw the hangman
his handkerchief to cover the pale face
he dared not look upon
<|endoftext|>

it is not barred
come in
nothing prevents you
<|endoftext|>

he needs no bolt nor bar to shut out thieves
he fears no enemies and has no friends
importunate enough to need a key
<|endoftext|>

come drink about
remember parson melham
and bless the man who first invented flip
<|endoftext|>

never
never
never
<|endoftext|>

if you want fiddling you must go elsewhere
to the green dragon and the admiral vernon
and other such disreputable places
<|endoftext|>

here's a health
to good king charles
will you not drink the king
<|endoftext|>

silence the drum
good citizens attend
to the new laws enacted by the court
<|endoftext|>

and for the repetition of the offence
shall have his other ear cut off and then
be branded in the palm of his right hand
<|endoftext|>

o patience of the lord
how long how long
ere thou avenge the blood of thine elect
<|endoftext|>

upsall i thank you
for speaking words such as some younger man
i or another should have said before you
<|endoftext|>

such laws as these are cruel and oppressive
a blot on this fair town and a disgrace
to any christian people
<|endoftext|>

and then you will be clapped
into the stocks with the red letter d
hung round about your neck for drunkenness
<|endoftext|>

then you're wanted
i arrest you
in the king's name
<|endoftext|>

i feel like master josselyn when he found
the hornet's nest and thought it some strange fruit
until the seeds came out and then he dropped it
<|endoftext|>

surely the power of satan must be great
upon the earth if even the elect
are thus deceived and fall away from grace
<|endoftext|>

you've done your duty though you've done it roughly
and every word you've uttered since you came
has stabbed me to the heart
<|endoftext|>

take heed lest i be called as brutus was
to be the judge of my own son
begone
<|endoftext|>

when you are tired of feeding upon husks
return again to duty and submission
but not till then
<|endoftext|>

it sends a dismal echo through my heart
as if forever it had closed between us
and i should look upon his face no more
<|endoftext|>

oh this will drag me down into my grave
to that eternal resting-place wherein
man lieth down and riseth not again
<|endoftext|>

till the heavens be no more he shall not wake
nor be roused from his sleep for thou dost change
his countenance and sendest him away
<|endoftext|>

i do acknowledge
among the passengers on board the swallow
were certain persons saying thee and thou
<|endoftext|>

and for the more effectual performance
hereof you are to give security
in bonds amounting to one hundred pounds
<|endoftext|>

you made a great disturbance
and uproar yesterday in the meeting-house
having your hat on
<|endoftext|>

i spake no words moved against none my hand
but by the hair they haled me out and dashed
their hooks into my face
<|endoftext|>

a bold man and a violent who sets
at naught the authority of our church and state
and is in banishment on pain of death
<|endoftext|>

make answer
without evasion
where
<|endoftext|>

'tis not the business of the lord you're doing
it is the devil's
will you take the oath
<|endoftext|>

christ is the word
the everlasting oath of god
i dare not
<|endoftext|>

yea i believe
the inner light and not the written word
to be the rule of life
<|endoftext|>

you are accused of making
an horrible disturbance and affrighting
the people in the meeting-house on sunday
<|endoftext|>

i do not deny
that i was present in your steeple-house
on the first day but i made no disturbance
<|endoftext|>

is it not written
upon my handmaidens will i pour out
my spirit and they shall prophesy
<|endoftext|>

your life is forfeit
unto the law and you shall surely die
and shall not live
<|endoftext|>

those who have gone before you said the same
and yet no judgment of the lord hath fallen
upon us
<|endoftext|>

i cannot give consent while other men
who have been banished upon pain of death
are now in their own houses here among us
<|endoftext|>

blessed are ye when men shall persecute you
and shall revile you and shall say against you
all manner of evil falsely for my sake
<|endoftext|>

i forgive
all who have injured me
what hast thou done
<|endoftext|>

there are invisible bars i cannot break
there are invisible doors that shut me in
and keep me ever steadfast to my purpose
<|endoftext|>

thy priest hath been with me this day to save me
not only from the death that comes to all
but from the second death
<|endoftext|>

when death the healer shall have touched our eyes
with moist clay of the grave then shall we see
the truth as we have never yet beheld it
<|endoftext|>

i am as homeless as the wind that moans
and wanders through the streets
oh come with me
<|endoftext|>

do not delay
thy god shall be my god
and where thou goest i will go
<|endoftext|>

yet will i not deny it nor conceal it
from the first moment i beheld thy face
i felt a tenderness in my soul towards thee
<|endoftext|>

my mind has since been inward to the lord
waiting his word
it has not yet been spoken
<|endoftext|>

i cannot wait
trust me
oh come with me
<|endoftext|>

alas
good-night
i will not say good-by
<|endoftext|>

he said confound the stocks because they put him
into his own
he was the first man in them
<|endoftext|>

and here's my host of the three mariners
my creditor and trusty taverner
my corporal in the great artillery
<|endoftext|>

well as your time is out you may come down
the law allows you now to go at large
like elder oliver's horse upon the common
<|endoftext|>

i will go with you to the governor's
and wait outside there sailing off and on
if i am wanted you can hoist a signal
<|endoftext|>

oh no i thank you
i am not a stranger
here in your crooked little town
<|endoftext|>

well roxbury and dorchester must take
their share of shame
she will be whipped in each
<|endoftext|>

and she a child
oh pitiful
pitiful
<|endoftext|>

the wrath of god hangs over thee and the day
is near at hand when thou shalt be abandoned
to desolation and the breeding of nettles
<|endoftext|>

the bodies of cromwell ireton and bradshaw
have been dragged from their graves and publicly
hanged in their shrouds at tyburn
<|endoftext|>

i tell you richard bellingham i tell you
that this is the beginning of a struggle
of which no mortal can foresee the end
<|endoftext|>

there's a dull pain keeps knocking at my heart
dolefully saying set thy house in order
for thou shalt surely die and shalt not live
<|endoftext|>

he has been put in irons with his neck
and heels tied close together and so left
from five in the morning until nine at night
<|endoftext|>

he has been kept five days
in prison without food and cruelly beaten
so that his limbs were cold his senses stopped
<|endoftext|>

edith
edith
edith
<|endoftext|>

it is in vain
i call she answers not
i follow but i find no trace of her
<|endoftext|>

away thou horrible vision
leave me
leave me
<|endoftext|>

o silent sombre and deserted streets
to me ye 're peopled with a sad procession
and echo only to the voice of sorrow
<|endoftext|>

o houses full of peacefulness and sleep
far better were it to awake no more
than wake to look upon such scenes again
<|endoftext|>

our thoughts are free
they cannot be shut up
in prison wall nor put to death on scaffolds
<|endoftext|>

it is the dawn of day
that chases the old darkness from our sky
and tills the land with liberty and light
<|endoftext|>

i am not one of those who think a sup
of this new england air is better worth
than a whole draught of our old england's ale
<|endoftext|>

no all are pardoned
all are set free by order of the court
but some of them would fain return to england
<|endoftext|>

you must not take them
upon that condition
your bond is cancelled
<|endoftext|>

i always speak officially
to prove it
here is the bond
<|endoftext|>

i say confound the tedious man
with his strange speaking-trumpet
can i go
<|endoftext|>

i am not superstitions bellingham
and yet i tremble lest it may have been
a judgment on him
<|endoftext|>

and furthermore brave richard davenport
the captain of the castle in the storm
has been struck dead by lightning
<|endoftext|>

o white white white
would that my soul had wings
as spotless as those shining sails to fly with
<|endoftext|>

now lay this cushion straight
i thank you
hark
<|endoftext|>

o absalom my son
i feel the world
sinking beneath me sinking sinking sinking
<|endoftext|>

death knocks
i go to meet him
welcome death
<|endoftext|>

endicott
endicott
he makes no answer
<|endoftext|>

the death of cattle and the blight of corn
the shipwreck the tornado and the fire
these are my doings and they know it not
<|endoftext|>

what shape is this
what monstrous apparition
exceeding fierce that none may pass that way
<|endoftext|>

then tell me witch and woman
for you must know the pathways through this wood
where lieth salem village
<|endoftext|>

i can ride through the air upon a stick
above the tree-tops and above the houses
and no one see me no one overtake me
<|endoftext|>

pray you be seated
you must be fatigued
with your long ride through unfrequented woods
<|endoftext|>

advise me reverend sir
i look to you
for counsel and for guidance in this matter
<|endoftext|>

dear sir we have inquired
sifted the matter thoroughly through and through
and then resifted it
<|endoftext|>

ah reverend sir
believe me in such cases
the only safety is in acting promptly
<|endoftext|>

't is not the part of wisdom to delay
in things where not to do is still to do
a deed more fatal than the deed we shrink from
<|endoftext|>

a drowsiness is stealing over me
which is not sleep for though i close mine eyes
i am awake and in another world
<|endoftext|>

dim faces of the dead and of the absent
come floating up before me floating fading
and disappearing
<|endoftext|>

yes something more
an island with the sea
breaking all round it like a blooming hedge
<|endoftext|>

it is san salvador
where tituba was born
what see you now
<|endoftext|>

a woman lying on a bed of leaves
wasted and worn away
ah she is dying
<|endoftext|>

you terrify me tituba
oh save me
from those who make me pine and waste away
<|endoftext|>

that i do not know
but you will see them
they will come to you
<|endoftext|>

poor child
how thin she is
how wan and wasted
<|endoftext|>

you now see
with your own eyes and touch with your own hands
the mysteries of this witchcraft
<|endoftext|>

one would need
the hands of briareus and the eyes of argus
to see and touch them all
<|endoftext|>

i can see nothing
is this apparition
visibly there and yet we cannot see it
<|endoftext|>

it is
the spectre is invisible
unto our grosser senses but she sees it
<|endoftext|>

look
look
there is another clad in gray
<|endoftext|>

she holds a spindle in her hand and threatens
to stab me with it
it is goodwife corey
<|endoftext|>

the laws that govern
the spiritual world prevent our seeing
things palpable and visible to her
<|endoftext|>

beholding this
it were indeed by far more credulous
to be incredulous than to believe
<|endoftext|>

none but a sadducee who doubts of all
pertaining to the spiritual world
could doubt such manifest and damning proofs
<|endoftext|>

the cattle are all running to the woods
john gloyd
where is the man
<|endoftext|>

call all the men
be quick
go after them
<|endoftext|>

sad things indeed the saddest you can hear
of bridget bishop
she's cried out upon
<|endoftext|>

they'll little help her now her caps and ribbons
and her red paragon bodice and her plumes
with which she flaunted in the meeting-house
<|endoftext|>

i wonder you should
i do not believe
in witches nor in witchcraft
<|endoftext|>

did not the witch of endor bring the ghost
of samuel from his grave
the bible says so
<|endoftext|>

i hope this richard gardner will bring him
a gale of good sound common-sense to blow
the fog of these delusions from his brain
<|endoftext|>

ho
martha
martha
<|endoftext|>

then let it lie there
i'll ride to the village
and say you are a witch
<|endoftext|>

a melancholy end
who would have thought
that bridget bishop e'er would come to this
<|endoftext|>

accused convicted and condemned to death
for witchcraft
and so good a woman too
<|endoftext|>

how do i know but under my own roof
i too may harbor witches and some devil
be plotting and contriving against me
<|endoftext|>

the night his house was burned i was in bed
and i can prove it
why we are old friends
<|endoftext|>

he said you did it out of spite to him
for taking part against you in the quarrel
you had with your john gloyd about his wages
<|endoftext|>

well
what of them
have you found them
<|endoftext|>

they will not break his fences any more
though they may break his heart
and what care i
<|endoftext|>

i say if any man
can have a devil in him then that man
is proctor is john proctor and no other
<|endoftext|>

he says i burned his house
i was in bed
and fast asleep that night and i can prove it
<|endoftext|>

i do not like that gloyd
i think him crafty
not to be trusted sullen and untruthful
<|endoftext|>

why can't they let him rest
why must they drag him
out of his grave to give me a bad name
<|endoftext|>

i did not kill him
in his bed he died
as most men die because his hour had come
<|endoftext|>

no i do not think
i know the meaning of that word
why frightened
<|endoftext|>

she started from the bushes by the path
and had a basket full of herbs and roots
for some witch-broth or other the old hag
<|endoftext|>

how did she look
you saw her
you were there
<|endoftext|>

i cannot say
as we forgive those that have sinned against us
when i do not forgive them
<|endoftext|>

say angry say right angry
i was never
in a more devilish temper in my life
<|endoftext|>

i'm sorry for it
i'll control myself
another time and keep my temper down
<|endoftext|>

if they would only seize the afflicted children
and put them in the workhouse where they should be
there'd be an end of all this wickedness
<|endoftext|>

and then again
if any shall be put to death for witchcraft
we do but kill the body not the soul
<|endoftext|>

you heard the evidence
produced before us yesterday at the trial
of bridget bishop
<|endoftext|>

and when she cast her eyes on the afflicted
they were struck down and this in such a manner
there could be no collusion in the business
<|endoftext|>

and when the accused but laid her hand upon them
as they lay in their swoons they straight revived
although they stirred not when the others touched them
<|endoftext|>

we came to ask you
you being with us in church covenant
what part you have if any in these matters
<|endoftext|>

how can you say that it is a delusion
when all our learned and good men believe it
our ministers and worshipful magistrates
<|endoftext|>

you answer boldly
the afflicted children
say you appeared to them
<|endoftext|>

they said that you foresaw our visit here
and blinded them so that they could not see
the clothes you wore
<|endoftext|>

and the elders and the nobles in the city
did even as jezebel the wife of ahab
had sent to them and written in the letters
<|endoftext|>

now we'll rest awhile
and take our nooning
what's the matter with you
<|endoftext|>

do you see that
don't tell me it's not witchcraft
two of us could not lift that cask as he does
<|endoftext|>

what is that
i surely
heard some one calling me by name
<|endoftext|>

the dream
the dream
o god be merciful
<|endoftext|>

if hard work and low wages make good masters
then he is one
but i think otherwise
<|endoftext|>

that's witchcraft
why if they had teeth like yours
't would be no wonder if the girls were bitten
<|endoftext|>

and then those ghosts that come out of their graves
and cry you murdered us
you murdered us
<|endoftext|>

and there's old corey he has got a horseshoe
nailed on his doorstep to keep off the witches
and all the same his wife has gone to prison
<|endoftext|>

oh she's no witch
i'll swear that goodwife corey
never did harm to any living creature
<|endoftext|>

and now be quiet will you
i am tired
and want to sleep here on the grass a little
<|endoftext|>

the hypocrite
she's always on her knees
but she prays to the devil when she prays
<|endoftext|>

the meeting-house is full
i never saw
so great a crowd before
<|endoftext|>

we shall find room enough by elbowing
our way among them
put your shoulder to it
<|endoftext|>

we have not sent for you nor are we here
to hear you pray but to examine you
in whatsoever is alleged against you
<|endoftext|>

i never had to do with any witchcraft
since i was born
i am a gospel woman
<|endoftext|>

then answer me: when certain persons came
to see you yesterday how did you know
beforehand why they came
<|endoftext|>

i had had speech
the children said i hurt them and i thought
these people came to question me about it
<|endoftext|>

i must speak the truth
i did not tell her
it was some one else
<|endoftext|>

she threatened me stabbed at me with her spindle
and when my brother thrust her with his sword
he tore her gown and cut a piece away
<|endoftext|>

and there are persons here who know the truth
of what has now been said
what answer make you
<|endoftext|>

did you not
on one occasion hide your husband's saddle
to hinder him from coming to the sessions
<|endoftext|>

what then was the book
you showed to this young woman and besought her
to write in it
<|endoftext|>

the next sabbath
is the communion day but martha corey
will not be there
<|endoftext|>

what
is it not enough
would you hear more
<|endoftext|>

is it not true that fourteen head of cattle
to you belonging broke from their enclosure
and leaped into the river and were drowned
<|endoftext|>

then i will tell you
it is some one near you
you see her now this woman your own wife
<|endoftext|>

go quick
they're waiting for you
you are late
<|endoftext|>

the dream
the dream
the dream
<|endoftext|>

i know my death is foreordained by you
mine and my wife's
therefore i will not answer
<|endoftext|>

i've seen him lead the field
on a hot day in mowing and against
us younger men and i have wrestled with him
<|endoftext|>

it might have been an easier death
your doom
will be on your own head and not on ours
<|endoftext|>

giles corey and martha corey are in prison
down there in salem village
both are witches
<|endoftext|>

and now i find him shipwrecked utterly
drifting upon this sea of sorceries
and lost perhaps beyond all aid of man
<|endoftext|>

and disappoint my foes
they are but thine avenging sword
whose wounds are swift to close
<|endoftext|>

hark hark
it is her voice
she is not dead
<|endoftext|>

corey hides his face in his hands
enter the jailer followed by
richard gardner
<|endoftext|>

of all the friends i had in happier days
you are the first ay and the only one
that comes to seek me out in my disgrace
<|endoftext|>

i thank you
there is something in your presence
i know not what it is that gives me strength
<|endoftext|>

giles corey
come
the hour has struck
<|endoftext|>

the life of man is a gleam
of light that comes and goes
like the course of the holy stream
<|endoftext|>

but alas
alas for me
not yet this rest shall be
<|endoftext|>

and that voice still soundeth on
from the centuries that are gone
to the centuries that shall be
<|endoftext|>

the dowry of my sister cleopatra
when she was wed to ptolemy and now
won back and made more wonderful by me
<|endoftext|>

they must have hippodromes and games and baths
stage-plays and festivals and most of all
the dionysia
<|endoftext|>

have i not sacked the temple and on the altar
set up the statue of olympian zeus
to hellenize it
<|endoftext|>

and who hath said it
who hath set in motion
that sorry jest
<|endoftext|>

they shall be made to eat the flesh of swine
or they shall die
where are they
<|endoftext|>

there let them stay and starve
till i am ready to make greeks of them
after my fashion
<|endoftext|>

they shall stay and starve
my lord the ambassadors of samaria
await thy pleasure
<|endoftext|>

only the royal sanction
to give a name unto a nameless temple
upon mount gerizim
<|endoftext|>

your nameless temple shall receive the name
of jupiter hellenius
ye may go
<|endoftext|>

't is of good augury
the rest will follow
till the whole land is hellenized
<|endoftext|>

yesterday eleazer an old man
being fourscore years and ten chose rather death
by torture than to eat the flesh of swine
<|endoftext|>

hundreds have fled already to the mountains
of ephraim where judas maccabaeus
hath raised the standard of revolt against thee
<|endoftext|>

god looketh on us and hath comfort in us
as moses in his song of old declared
he in his servants shall be comforted
<|endoftext|>

i knew thou wouldst not fail
he speaks no more
he is beyond all pain
<|endoftext|>

it sounds to me as from another world
and makes the petty miseries of this
seem unto me as naught and less than naught
<|endoftext|>

it is good o king
being put to death by men to look for hope
from god to be raised up again by him
<|endoftext|>

this silence is more terrible to me
than any sound than any cry of pain
that might escape the lips of one who dies
<|endoftext|>

wherefore art thou the only living thing
among thy brothers dead
art thou afraid
<|endoftext|>

never will i obey the king's commandment
but the commandment of the ancient law
that was by moses given unto our fathers
<|endoftext|>

ye both shall perish
by torments worse than any that your god
here or hereafter hath in store for me
<|endoftext|>

thy footsteps will not wake them nor thy voice
nor wilt thou hear amid thy troubled dreams
thy children crying for thee in the night
<|endoftext|>

none can escape from death
say that ye come
to die for israel and ye are welcome
<|endoftext|>

the princes and the elders weep and wail
the young men and the maidens are made feeble
the beauty of the women hath been changed
<|endoftext|>

both men and women die old men and young
old eleazer died: and mahala
with all her seven sons
<|endoftext|>

to-day he shall be lifted up to-morrow
shall not be found because he is returned
unto his dust his thought has come to nothing
<|endoftext|>

there is no peace between us nor can be
until this banner floats upon the walls
of our jerusalem
<|endoftext|>

the power of god
whose breath shall scatter your white tents abroad
as flakes of snow
<|endoftext|>

your mighty one in heaven
will not do battle on the seventh day
it is his day of rest
<|endoftext|>

last night i dreamed a dream and in my vision
beheld onias our high-priest of old
who holding up his hands prayed for the jews
<|endoftext|>

its hateful aspect
insults us with the bitter memories
of other days
<|endoftext|>

lurking among the ruins of the temple
deep in its inner courts we found this man
clad as high-priest
<|endoftext|>

i am thy prisoner judas maccabaeus
and it would ill become me to conceal
my name or office
<|endoftext|>

what should prevent me now thou man of sin
from hanging at its side the head of one
who born a jew hath made himself a greek
<|endoftext|>

when hast thou
at any time to any man or woman
or even to any little child shown mercy
<|endoftext|>

i who made the jews
skip like the grasshoppers am made myself
to skip among these stones
<|endoftext|>

my lord
i am a messenger from antioch
sent here by lysias
<|endoftext|>

(throws up his hands and sinks into the
arms of attendants who lay him upon
a bank
<|endoftext|>

thy people whom i judged to be unworthy
to be so much as buried shall be equal
unto the citizens of antioch
<|endoftext|>

i will become a jew and will declare
through all the world that is inhabited
the power of god
<|endoftext|>

bring here the royal litter
we will bear him
in to the camp while yet he lives
<|endoftext|>

the old castle
needs not your presence
no one waits for you
<|endoftext|>

yours a child's sorrow smiling through its tears
but mine the grief of an impassioned woman
who drank her life up in one draught of love
<|endoftext|>

dreams or illusions call them what you will
they lift us from the commonplace of life
to better things
<|endoftext|>

are there no brighter dreams
no higher aspirations than the wish
to please and to be pleased
<|endoftext|>

and my cardinal
at itri in the courtyard of his palace
keeps a tame lion
<|endoftext|>

and so counterfeits
st
mark the evangelist
<|endoftext|>

and there vesuvius with its plume of smoke
and the great city stretched upon the shore
as in a dream
<|endoftext|>

michael angelo's studio
he is at work on the cartoon of the
last judgment
<|endoftext|>

that is the title they cajole me with
to make me do their work and leave my own
but having once begun i turn not back
<|endoftext|>

rise from your graves drowsy and drugged with death
as men who suddenly aroused from sleep
look round amazed and know not where they are
<|endoftext|>

so love the greatest emperor of them all
writes his in green at first but afterwards
in the imperial purple of our blood
<|endoftext|>

it is kind of you
to come to us who linger here like gossips
wasting the afternoon in idle talk
<|endoftext|>

pardon me gentlemen
but when i entered
i saw but the marchesa
<|endoftext|>

but that
is not what occupies my thoughts at present
nor why i sent for you messer michele
<|endoftext|>

i am doubtful
how i shall build how large to make the convent
and which way fronting
<|endoftext|>

i see no bar nor drawback to this building
and on our homeward way if it shall please you
we may together view the site
<|endoftext|>

the hours i count not
as a sun-dial but am like a clock
that tells the time as well by night as day
<|endoftext|>

the very memory of all honest living
is wiped away and even our tuscan tongue
corrupted to a lombard dialect
<|endoftext|>

we shall soon see then as valori says
whether the duke can best spare honest men
or honest men the duke
<|endoftext|>

heaven help us all i will not tarry longer
for you have need of rest
good-night
<|endoftext|>

fra bastiano how your portly presence
contrasts with that of the spare florentine
who has just left me
<|endoftext|>

sung by the tenor of the papal choir
and in a papal mass seemed out of place
there's something wrong in it
<|endoftext|>

't is a damascus blade you see the inscription
in arabic: la allah illa allah
there is no god but god
<|endoftext|>

how beautiful
in fashion and in finish
it is perfect
<|endoftext|>

i will keep it
in memory of the donor
many thanks
<|endoftext|>

beware
i remember that bolsena's eels
and vernage wine once killed a pope of rome
<|endoftext|>

't was a french pope and then so long ago
who knows
perhaps the story is not true
<|endoftext|>

the night is far advanced
i fear to stay too late and weary you
with these discussions
<|endoftext|>

dear countess
if loyalty to friendship be a claim
upon your confidence then i may claim it
<|endoftext|>

but the inward life
that you know not 't is known but to myself
and is to me a mystery and a pain
<|endoftext|>

yes your meditations
are more of this world and its vanities
than of the world to come
<|endoftext|>

yet have i seen you listen
enraptured when fra bernardino preached
of faith and hope and charity
<|endoftext|>

for i confess to live among my friends
is paradise to me my purgatory
is living among people i dislike
<|endoftext|>

teach me then
to harmonize the discord of my life
and stop the painful jangle of these wires
<|endoftext|>

that is a task impossible until
you tune your heart-strings to a higher key
than earthly melodies
<|endoftext|>

but lead me privately so that the world
hear not my steps i would not give occasion
for talk among the people
<|endoftext|>

do me the kindness then
to speak without reserve and with all frankness
if you divine the truth will i confess it
<|endoftext|>

this warrants me in saying
you think you can win heaven by compromise
and not by verdict
<|endoftext|>

hark
the convent bells
are ringing it is midnight i must leave you
<|endoftext|>

i make you the same answer
that was not
a pledge of love but of pure gratitude
<|endoftext|>

come to my arms and to my heart once more
my soul goes out to meet you and embrace you
for we are of the sisterhood of sorrow
<|endoftext|>

let me look at you
what a joy it is
to see your face to hear your voice again
<|endoftext|>

you shall hear all
but first sit down and listen patiently
while i confess myself
<|endoftext|>

old as i am i have at last consented
to the entreaties and the supplications
of michael angelo
<|endoftext|>

no this is a friend
of yours as well as mine the lady julia
the duchess of trajetto
<|endoftext|>

't is long since i have seen your face my lady
pardon me if i say that having seen it
one never can forget it
<|endoftext|>

and now i come to add one labor more
if you will call that labor which is pleasure
and only pleasure
<|endoftext|>

my dear maestro
have you then forgotten
the story of sophocles in his old age
<|endoftext|>

't is an illusion
a fabulous story that will lead old men
into a thousand follies and conceits
<|endoftext|>

it was of no great import nothing more
nor less than my late visit to ferrara
and what i saw there in the ducal palace
<|endoftext|>

the men that women marry
and why they marry them will always be
a marvel and a mystery to the world
<|endoftext|>

and then the duchess how shall i describe her
or tell the merits of that happy nature
which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing
<|endoftext|>

frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season
and these precocious intellects portend
a life of sorrow or an early death
<|endoftext|>

and what poets
were there to sing you madrigals and praise
olympia's eyes and cherubina's tresses
<|endoftext|>

silence and solitude the soul's best friends
are with me here and the tumultuous world
makes no more noise than the remotest planet
<|endoftext|>

how damp and cold it was
how my bones ached
and my head reeled when i was working there
<|endoftext|>

there is a charm
a certain something in the atmosphere
that all men feel and no man can describe
<|endoftext|>

the figure vanished and there rose a cry
out of the darkness long and fierce and loud
with imprecations in all languages
<|endoftext|>

say have you seen our friend fra bastian lately
since by a turn of fortune he became
friar of the signet
<|endoftext|>

faith a pretty artist
to pass his days in stamping leaden seals
on papal bulls
<|endoftext|>

be at it late and early persevere
and work right on through censure and applause
or else abandon art
<|endoftext|>

no man works harder
then i do
i am not a moment idle
<|endoftext|>

the god who made me
knows why he made me what i am a goldsmith
a mere artificer
<|endoftext|>

i know my life is wasted and consumed
in vanities but i have better hours
and higher aspirations than you think
<|endoftext|>

that was nothing
it did not kill me only lamed me slightly
i am quite well again
<|endoftext|>

can you sit down in them
on summer afternoons and play the lute
or sing or sleep the time away
<|endoftext|>

i have not time
did you meet benvenuto
as you came up the stair
<|endoftext|>

i cannot go
the sibylline leaves of life
grow precious now when only few remain
<|endoftext|>

i seem to hear her hearing the boughs and breezes
and leaves and birds lamenting and the waters
murmuring flee along the verdant herbage
<|endoftext|>

i beg you to take note of what he says
about the papal seals for that concerns
your office and yourself
<|endoftext|>

ah these old hands can fashion fairer shapes
in marble and can paint diviner pictures
since i have known her
<|endoftext|>

his wealth is scattered to the winds his children
are long since dead but those celestial gates
survive and keep his name and memory green
<|endoftext|>

sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine and sharp
the words you speak because the heart within you
is sweet unto the core
<|endoftext|>

raphael is not dead
he doth but sleep for how can he be dead
who lives immortal in the hearts of men
<|endoftext|>

he only drank the precious wine of youth
the outbreak of the grapes before the vintage
was trodden to bitterness by the feet of men
<|endoftext|>

i have but words of praise and admiration
for his great genius and the world is fairer
that he lived in it
<|endoftext|>

each one performs his life-work and then leaves it
those that come after him will estimate
his influence on the age in which he lived
<|endoftext|>

so you have left at last your still lagoons
your city of silence floating in the sea
and come to us in rome
<|endoftext|>

there are things in rome
that one might walk bare-footed here from venice
but to see once and then to die content
<|endoftext|>

i felt so once but i have grown familiar
with desolation and it has become
no more a pain to me but a delight
<|endoftext|>

and paints with fires
sudden and splendid as the lightning paints
the cloudy vault of heaven
<|endoftext|>

indeed i know not
't was a foolish boast
and does no harm to any but himself
<|endoftext|>

when you two
are gone who is there that remains behind
to seize the pencil falling from your fingers
<|endoftext|>

i hear
your son orazio and your nephew marco
mentioned with honor
<|endoftext|>

that acrisius did well
to lock such beauty in a brazen tower
and hide it from all eyes
<|endoftext|>

and more that you were present
and saw the showery jove from high olympus
descend in all his splendor
<|endoftext|>

messer michele all the arts are yours
not one alone and therefore i may venture
to put a question to you
<|endoftext|>

how from the canvas they detach themselves
till they deceive the eye and one would say
it is a statue with a screen behind it
<|endoftext|>

and now maestro i will say once more
how admirable i esteem your work
and leave you without further interruption
<|endoftext|>

death is the chillness that precedes the dawn
we shudder for a moment then awake
in the broad sunshine of the other life
<|endoftext|>

hand me the mirror
i would fain behold
what change comes o'er our features when we die
<|endoftext|>

do you remember julia when we walked
one afternoon upon the castle terrace
at ischia on the day before you left me
<|endoftext|>

oh do not speak of him
his sudden death
o'ercomes me now as it o'ercame me then
<|endoftext|>

therefore be cautious
keep your secret thought
locked in your breast
<|endoftext|>

not pale but whiter than the sheet of snows
that without wind on some fair hill-top lies
her weary body seemed to find repose
<|endoftext|>

like a sweet slumber in her lovely eyes
when now the spirit was no longer there
was what is dying called by the unwise
<|endoftext|>

how wonderful
the light upon her face
shines from the windows of another world
<|endoftext|>

i must then the short-coming of my means
piece out by stepping forward as the spartan
was told to add a step to his short sword
<|endoftext|>

death's lightnings strike to right and left of me
and like a ruined wall the world around me
crumbles away and i am left alone
<|endoftext|>

when one pope dies another is soon made
and i can make a dozen cardinals
but cannot make one michael angelo
<|endoftext|>

you cardinal salviati
are an old man
are you incapable
<|endoftext|>

i have seen his model
and have approved it
but here comes the artist
<|endoftext|>

beware of him
he may make persians of you
to carry burdens on your backs forever
<|endoftext|>

come forward dear maestro
in these gardens
all ceremonies of our court are banished
<|endoftext|>

how graciously
your holiness commiserates old age
and its infirmities
<|endoftext|>

i would advise
your holiness not to cross it or not often
it is not safe
<|endoftext|>

there is some mystery here
these cardinals
stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes
<|endoftext|>

deputies
of the commissioners and they complain
of insufficient light in the three chapels
<|endoftext|>

monsignore
perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting
above there are to go three other windows
<|endoftext|>

therefore i pray your holiness release me
take off from me the burden of this work
let me go back to florence
<|endoftext|>

and the grasshopper
shall be a burden and desire shall fail
because man goeth unto his long home
<|endoftext|>

i have had my dream
and cannot carry out my great conception
and put it into act
<|endoftext|>

the same reason
that keeps you standing sentinel at your door
the air of this delicious summer morning
<|endoftext|>

i say no news from florence: i am wrong
for benvenuto writes that he is coming
to be my guest in rome
<|endoftext|>

ah
benvenuto
't is a masterpiece
<|endoftext|>

tradition says that fifteen thousand men
were toiling for ten years incessantly
upon this amphitheatre
<|endoftext|>

think you that i approve such cruelties
because i marvel at the architects
who built these walls and curved these noble arches
<|endoftext|>

your work i say again is nobler work
in so far as its end and aim are nobler
and this is but a ruin like the rest
<|endoftext|>

its vaulted passages are made the caverns
of robbers and are haunted by the ghosts
of murdered men
<|endoftext|>

a certain man copernicus by name
sometime professor here in rome has whispered
it is the earth and not the sun that moves
<|endoftext|>

half sunk beneath the horizon
and yet not gone
twelve years are a long while
<|endoftext|>

ah generous master
how shall i e'er thank you
for such kind language
<|endoftext|>

dear benvenuto
i recognized the latent genius in you
but feared your vices
<|endoftext|>

a strange adventure
that could have happened to no man alive
but you my benvenuto
<|endoftext|>

the grand duke cosimo now reigns supreme
all liberty is dead
ah woe is me
<|endoftext|>

well now he writes to me that as a christian
he is ashamed of the unbounded freedom
with which i represent it
<|endoftext|>

he says i show mankind that i am wanting
in piety and religion in proportion
as i profess perfection in my art
<|endoftext|>

i represent the angels
without their heavenly glory and the saints
without a trace of earthly modesty
<|endoftext|>

he is at home there and he ought to know
what men avert their eyes from in such places
from the last judgment chiefly i imagine
<|endoftext|>

i will not think of it but let it pass
for a rude speech thrown at me in the street
as boys threw stones at dante
<|endoftext|>

but i grow old and weak
what wilt thou do
when i am dead urbino
<|endoftext|>

ay it will make thee rich
thou shalt not die
a beggar in a hospital
<|endoftext|>

thou hast served michael angelo
remember
henceforward thou shalt serve no other master
<|endoftext|>

i have just fled from it
it is beleaguered
by spanish troops led by the duke of alva
<|endoftext|>

so he calls them
and yet in fact these bright angelic legions
are only german lutherans
<|endoftext|>

there was of old a monk of wittenberg
who went to rome you may have heard of him
his name was luther and you know what followed
<|endoftext|>

o death why is it i cannot portray
thy form and features
do i stand too near thee
<|endoftext|>

you have been revelling with your boon companions
giorgio vasari and you come to me
at an untimely hour
<|endoftext|>

his holiness desires to see again
the drawing you once showed him of the dome
of the basilica
<|endoftext|>

ah me
ah me
what darkness of despair
<|endoftext|>

our lives are rivers gliding free
to that unfathomed boundless sea
the silent grave
<|endoftext|>

thither all earthly pomp and boast
roll to be swallowed up and lost
in one dark wave
<|endoftext|>

did we but use it as we ought
this world would school each wandering thought
to its high state
<|endoftext|>

faith wings the soul beyond the sky
up to that better world on high
for which we wait
<|endoftext|>

wealth and the high estate of pride
with what untimely speed they glide
how soon depart
<|endoftext|>

bid not the shadowy phantoms stay
the vassals of a mistress they
of fickle heart
<|endoftext|>

these gifts in fortune's hands are found
her swift revolving wheel turns round
and they are gone
<|endoftext|>

no rest the inconstant goddess knows
but changing and without repose
still hurries on
<|endoftext|>

where are the high-born dames and where
their gay attire and jewelled hair
and odors sweet
<|endoftext|>

where are the gentle knights that came
to kneel and breathe love's ardent flame
low at their feet
<|endoftext|>

where is the mazy dance of old
the flowing robes inwrought with gold
the dancers wore
<|endoftext|>

but o how false and full of guile
that world which wore so soft a smile
but to betray
<|endoftext|>

she that had been his friend before
now from the fated monarch tore
her charms away
<|endoftext|>

what was their prosperous estate
when high exalted and elate
with power and pride
<|endoftext|>

what but a transient gleam of light
a flame which glaring at its height
grew dim and died
<|endoftext|>

their deeds of mercy and of arms
in peaceful days or war's alarms
when thou dost show
<|endoftext|>

o death thy stern and angry face
one stroke of thy all-powerful mace
can overthrow
<|endoftext|>

to friends a friend how kind to all
the vassals of this ancient hall
and feudal fief
<|endoftext|>

what prudence with the old and wise
what grace in youthful gayeties
in all how sage
<|endoftext|>

benignant to the serf and slave
he showed the base and falsely brave
a lion's rage
<|endoftext|>

his soul to him who gave it rose
god lead it to its long repose
its glorious rest
<|endoftext|>

and though the warrior's sun has set
its light shall linger round us yet
bright radiant blest
<|endoftext|>

clear fount of light
my native land on high
bright with a glory that shall never fade
<|endoftext|>

mansion of truth
without a veil or shade
thy holy quiet meets the spirit's eye
<|endoftext|>

heavenward the bright perfections i adore
direct and the sure promise cheers the way
that whither love aspires there shall my dwelling be
<|endoftext|>

how without guile thy bosom all transparent
as the pure crystal lets the curious eye
thy secrets scan thy smooth round pebbles count
<|endoftext|>

many a corpse is bathed in thee
both of moors and eke of christians
slain with swords most cruelly
<|endoftext|>

the peasant leaves his plough afield
the reaper leaves his hook
and from his hand the shepherd-boy
<|endoftext|>

the young set up a shout of joy
the old forget their years
the feeble man grows stout of heart
<|endoftext|>

some day some day
o troubled breast
shalt thou find rest
<|endoftext|>

lakes full many in number their mirror held up for the mountains
held for the forests up in whose depths the high-horned reindeers
had their kingly walk and drank of a hundred brooklets
<|endoftext|>

lately between the two on a bear-skin (the skin it was coal-black
scarlet-red was the throat but the paws were shodden with silver
thorsten sat with his friends hospitality sitting with gladness
<|endoftext|>

oft when the moon through the cloudrack flew related the old man
wonders from distant lands he had seen and cruises of vikings
far away on the baltic and sea of the west and the white sea
<|endoftext|>

midway the floor burned ever the fire-flame
glad on its stone-built hearth and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue
looked the stars those heavenly friends down into the great hall
<|endoftext|>

round the walls upon nails of steel were hanging in order
breastplate and helmet together and here and there among them
downward lightened a sword as in winter evening a star shoots
<|endoftext|>

ever and anon went a maid round the hoard and filled up the drink-horns
ever she cast down her eyes and blushed in the shield her reflection
blushed too even as she this gladdened the drinking champions
<|endoftext|>

now the huntsman's band is ready
hurrah
over hill and dale
<|endoftext|>

straight the ancient king awakens
sweet has been my sleep he said
pleasantly sleeps one in the shadow guarded by a brave man's blade
<|endoftext|>

go not to the strand
ring with thy bride
after the stars spread their light through the sky
<|endoftext|>

perhaps in the sand
washed up by the tide
the bones of the outlawed viking may lie
<|endoftext|>

then quoth the king
't is mournful to hear
a man like a whimpering maiden cry
<|endoftext|>

pentecost day of rejoicing had come
the church of the village
gleaming stood in the morning's sheen
<|endoftext|>

on the spire of the bell
decked with a brazen cock the friendly flames of the spring-sun
glanced like the tongues of fire beheld by apostles aforetime
<|endoftext|>

also the church within was adorned for this was the season
when the young their parents' hope and the loved-ones of heaven
should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism
<|endoftext|>

but in front of the choir round the altar-piece painted by horberg
crept a garland gigantic and bright-curling tresses of angels
peeped like the sun from a cloud from out of the shadowy leaf-work
<|endoftext|>

hark
then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ
hover like voices from god aloft like invisible spirits
<|endoftext|>

friendly was he to behold and glad as the heralding angel
walked he among the crowds but still a contemplative grandeur
lay on his forehead as clear as on moss-covered gravestone a sunbeam
<|endoftext|>

and to the children explained the holy the highest in few words
thorough yet simple and clear for sublimity always is simple
both in sermon and song a child can seize on its meaning
<|endoftext|>

this is the hour of your trial the turning-point of existence
seed for the coming days without revocation departeth
now from your lips the confession bethink ye before ye make answer
<|endoftext|>

kneeling he read then the prayers of the consecration and softly
with him the children read at the close with tremulous accents
asked he the peace of heaven a benediction upon them
<|endoftext|>

sudden as struck from the clouds stood the teacher silent and laid his
hand on his forehead and cast his looks upward while thoughts high and holy
flew through the midst of his soul and his eyes glanced with wonderful brightness
<|endoftext|>

tokens are dead if the things live not
the light everlasting
unto the blind is not but is born of the eye that has vision
<|endoftext|>

decked like an altar before them there stood the green earth and above it
heaven opened itself as of old before stephen they saw there
radiant in glory the father and on his right hand the redeemer
<|endoftext|>

north sea
a glimpse of wessel rent
thy murky sky
<|endoftext|>

from denmark thunders tordenskiol
let each to heaven commend his soul
and fly
<|endoftext|>

and amid pleasures and alarm
and war and victory be thine arms
my grave
<|endoftext|>

now have i but their memory fondly cherished
god
may i never lose that too
<|endoftext|>

hold your tongues
both swabian
and saxon
<|endoftext|>

a bold bohemian cries
if there's a heaven upon this earth
in bohemia it lies
<|endoftext|>

thou mayest stand on the mainmast tall
for full to sinking is my house
with merry companions all
<|endoftext|>

whither o brooklet say i
thou hast with thy soft murmur
murmured my senses away
<|endoftext|>

that can no murmur be
't is the water-nymphs that are singing
their roundelays under me
<|endoftext|>

she can both false and friendly be
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

she gives a side-glance and looks down
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

and what she says it is not true
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

she knows how much it is best to show
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

it is a fool's-cap for thee to wear
beware
beware
<|endoftext|>

and yet all our sorrowings
and all our rejoicings
thou dost feel them all
<|endoftext|>

god hath wonders many
which we cannot fathom
placed within thy form
<|endoftext|>

when the heart is sinking
thou alone canst raise it
trembling in the storm
<|endoftext|>

should i speak it here
ye would stand aghast with fear
i am a prince of mighty sway
<|endoftext|>

pale the children both did look
but the guest a beaker took
golden wine will make you whole
<|endoftext|>

the children drank
gave many a courteous thank
o that draught was very cool
<|endoftext|>

spake the grim guest
from his hollow cavernous breast
roses in the spring i gather
<|endoftext|>

who leads us with a gentle hand
thither o thither
into the silent land
<|endoftext|>

the graybeard with trembling hand obeys
a purple light shines over all
it beams from the luck of edenhall
<|endoftext|>

o hemlock tree
o hemlock tree
how faithful are thy branches
<|endoftext|>

o maiden fair
o maiden fair
how faithless is thy bosom
<|endoftext|>

who has it not wants hardihood
who has it has much trouble and care
who once has had it has despair
<|endoftext|>

whilom love was like a tire and warmth and comfort it bespoke
but alas
it now is quenched and only bites us like the smoke
<|endoftext|>

ah
who would not then depart with gladness
to inherit heaven for earthly sadness
<|endoftext|>

thou shalt not fail
but ah be never
false as thy father was to me
<|endoftext|>

the men shoved off
men on their willing way
the bounden wood
<|endoftext|>

god thanked they
that to them the sea-journey
easy had been
<|endoftext|>

him the doubt disturbed
in his mind's thought
what these men might be
<|endoftext|>

went then to the shore
on his steed riding
the thane of hrothgar
<|endoftext|>

quickest is best
to make known
whence your coming may be
<|endoftext|>

in the foulness of earth
thou all wearest away
like to the loam
<|endoftext|>

with beast and bird the forest rings
each in his jargon cries or sings
and time throws off his cloak again
<|endoftext|>

gentle spring
in sunshine clad
well dost thou thy power display
<|endoftext|>

sweet babe
true portrait of thy father's face
sleep on the bosom that thy lips have pressed
<|endoftext|>

awake and chase this fatal thought
unclose
thine eye but for one moment on the light
<|endoftext|>

sweet error
he but slept i breathe again
come gentle dreams the hour of sleep beguile
<|endoftext|>

but death steals on there is no hope of life
in paradise where almoners live again
there are our couches spread there shall we rest from pain
<|endoftext|>

when he revived with a loud voice cried he
o heavenly father
holy saint marie
<|endoftext|>

beloved france
how have the good and brave
been torn from thee and left thee weak and poor
<|endoftext|>

when one beholds the dusky hedges blossom
a rustic bridal oh
how sweet it is
<|endoftext|>

o no
for a maiden frail i trow
never bore so lofty a brow
<|endoftext|>

she promises one a village swain
another a happy wedding-day
and the bride a lovely boy straightway
<|endoftext|>

yet jane has named him not these three days past
arrived
yet keeps aloof so far
<|endoftext|>

come
keep the promise of that happier day
that i may keep the faith to thee i plighted
<|endoftext|>

i suffer
o my god
come make me glad
<|endoftext|>

earth i forget and heaven and all distresses
when seated by my side my hand he presses
but when alone remember all
<|endoftext|>

ah
woe is me
then bear me to my grave
<|endoftext|>

away
he will return
i do but rave
<|endoftext|>

he swore it by our saviour dear
he could not come at his own will
is weary or perhaps is ill
<|endoftext|>

and that deceives me not
't is he
't is he
<|endoftext|>

angela married
and not send
to tell her secret unto me
<|endoftext|>

paul be not sad
't is a holiday
to-morrow put on thy doublet gay
<|endoftext|>

away with a hop and a jump went paul
and as he whistled along the hall
entered jane the crippled crone
<|endoftext|>

but thou art cold art chill as death
my little friend
what ails thee sweet
<|endoftext|>

thus margaret said
where are we
we ascend
<|endoftext|>

at length the bell
with booming sound
sends forth resounding round
<|endoftext|>

't is spoken and sudden at the grooms-man's side
't is he
a well-known voice has cried
<|endoftext|>

let us by the fire
ever higher
sing them till the night expire
<|endoftext|>

let us by the fire
ever higher
sing them fill the night expire
<|endoftext|>

to m
duperrier gentleman of aix in provence on the
death of his daughter
<|endoftext|>

and shall the sad discourse
whispered within thy heart by tenderness paternal
only augment its force
<|endoftext|>

dear child
who me resemblest so
it whispered come o come with me
<|endoftext|>

and so whenever death shall come to close
the happy moments that my days compose
i full of years shall die obscure alone
<|endoftext|>

how wretched is the man with honors crowned
who having not the one thing needful found
dies known to all but to himself unknown
<|endoftext|>

and when therefrom i had withdrawn a little
mine eyes that i might question my conductor
again i saw it brighter grown and larger
<|endoftext|>

thereafter on all sides of it appeared
i knew not what of white and underneath
little by little there came forth another
<|endoftext|>

see how he scorns all human arguments
so that no oar he wants nor other sail
than his own wings between so distant shores
<|endoftext|>

see how he holds them pointed straight to heaven
fanning the air with the eternal pinions
that do not moult themselves like mortal hair
<|endoftext|>

then made he sign of holy rood upon them
whereat all cast themselves upon the shore
and he departed swiftly as he came
<|endoftext|>

already my slow steps had led me on
into the ancient wood so far that i
could see no more the place where i had entered
<|endoftext|>

that they might fear thee more or love thee less
who in the splendor of thy loveliness
seem wasting yet to mortal combat dare
<|endoftext|>

if by its nature unto heaven returns
this element me kindled in its blaze
will it bear upward when my life is fled
<|endoftext|>

the dreams of love that were so sweet of yore
what are they now when two deaths may be mine
one sure and one forecasting its alarms
<|endoftext|>

painting and sculpture satisfy no more
the soul now turning to the love divine
that oped to embrace us on the cross its arms
<|endoftext|>

vainly did cruel death attempt to stay
the rumor of thy virtuous renown
that lethe's waters could not wash away
<|endoftext|>

a thousand leaves since he hath stricken thee down
speak of thee nor to thee could heaven convey
except through death a refuge and a crown
<|endoftext|>

among a thousand proofs let one suffice
that as his exile hath no parallel
ne'er walked the earth a greater man than he
<|endoftext|>

i perish day by day
the sunshine fails the shadows grow more dreary
and i am near to fail infirm and weary
<|endoftext|>

let thy proud heart relent
come back to my tall white tent
come back my only son
<|endoftext|>

where are our shallow fords
and where
the power of kazan with its fourfold gates
<|endoftext|>

i come from yon mountain high and cold
where lieth the new snow on the old
and melts in the summer heat
<|endoftext|>

i go to the river there below
where in bunches the violets grow
and sun and shadow meet
<|endoftext|>

i go to the garden in the vale
where all night long the nightingale
her love-song doth repeat
<|endoftext|>

welcome o stork
that dost wing
thy flight from the far-away
<|endoftext|>

we our country's bounds and pleasant pastures relinquish
we our country fly thou tityrus stretched in the shadow
teachest the woods to resound with the name of the fair amaryllis
<|endoftext|>

o meliboeus a god for us this leisure created
for he will be unto me a god forever his altar
oftentimes shall imbue a tender lamb from our sheepfolds
<|endoftext|>

though from my wattled folds there went forth many a victim
and the unctuous cheese was pressed for the city ungrateful
never did my right hand return home heavy with money
<|endoftext|>

what could i do
no power had i to escape from my bondage
nor had i power elsewhere to recognize gods so propitious
<|endoftext|>

fortunate old man
here among familiar rivers
and these sacred founts shalt thou take the shadowy coolness
<|endoftext|>

on this side a hedge along the neighboring cross-road
where hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow
often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee
<|endoftext|>

yonder beneath the high rock the pruner shall sing to the breezes
nor meanwhile shalt thy heart's delight the hoarse wood-pigeons
nor the turtle-dove cease to mourn from aerial elm-trees
<|endoftext|>

sooner the border-lands of both overpassed shall the exiled
parthian drink of the soane or the german drink of the tigris
than the face of him shall glide away from my bosom
<|endoftext|>

ah shall i ever a long time hence the bounds of my country
and the roof of my lowly cottage covered with greensward
seeing with wonder behold my kingdoms a handful of wheat-ears
<|endoftext|>

naked and barren plains without leaves or trees we behold here
places alas
unto which no happy man would repair
<|endoftext|>

where is the thatch-roofed village the home of acadian farmers
men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands
darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven
<|endoftext|>

neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
<|endoftext|>

bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
<|endoftext|>

silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
followed the old man's song and united the fragments together
<|endoftext|>

meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure
sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise
over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows
<|endoftext|>

silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
<|endoftext|>

gabriel lajeunesse
they said o yes
we have seen him
<|endoftext|>

onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness somber with forests
day after day they glided adown the turbulent river
night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
<|endoftext|>

nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands
darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
<|endoftext|>

gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward
maur and st
martin
<|endoftext|>

thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
<|endoftext|>

so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow
mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions
homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission
<|endoftext|>

and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st
lawrence
saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission
<|endoftext|>

then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead
dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
<|endoftext|>

in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy
maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun
and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story
<|endoftext|>

in reading there should be a gentle labor of the former half of the
line and gentle acceleration of the latter half

<|endoftext|>

the english were not without blame since it must be admitted they had
covetous eyes upon the rich farms of the acadians and an opportunity to take
possession of them would not be unwelcome

her voice would falter in its song
and tears would slide from out her eye
silent as they were doing wrong
<|endoftext|>

but that they do not rise and sink
with his calm breathing i should think
that he were dropped asleep
<|endoftext|>

alas
too deep too deep
is this his slumber
<|endoftext|>

upon the seaweed slimy and dark
that waves its arms so lank and brown
beckoning for thee
<|endoftext|>

kind hearts are beating on every side
ah why should we lie so coldly curled
alone in the shell of this great world
<|endoftext|>

heaven help me
how could i forget
to beg of thee dear violet
<|endoftext|>

as if the cloud let go
leapt bodily below
to whelm the earth in one mad overthrow
<|endoftext|>

glad of all weathers
still seeming best
upward or downward
<|endoftext|>

let my heart be
fresh changeful constant
upward like thee
<|endoftext|>

oh yes
his fatherland must be
as the blue heaven wide and free
<|endoftext|>

or with gladness are they full
for the night so beautiful
and longing for those far-off spheres
<|endoftext|>

and i were mean to weep
that thou hast left life's shallows
and dost possess the deep

'had i trusted in my nature
and had faith in lowly things

where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim

<|endoftext|>

how did ye triumph now in margaret's breast

<|endoftext|>

through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant
brimming the church with gold and purple mist
meet atmosphere to bosom that rich chant
<|endoftext|>

strewed the pale corpse with many a milkwhite bloom
and parted the bright hair and on the breast
crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest
<|endoftext|>

such am i now: immortal woe hath made
my heart a seer and my soul a judge
between the substance and the shadow of truth
<|endoftext|>

all other glories are as falling stars
but universal nature watches theirs
such strength is won by love of humankind
<|endoftext|>

endless despair shall be thy caucasus
and memory thy vulture thou wilt find
oblivion far lonelier than this peak

behold thy destiny
thou think'st it much
that i should brave thee miserable god

so haply meeting in the afternoon
some comrades who were playing at the dice
he joined them and forgot all else beside

and have predestined sway: all other things

the old chief feeling now wellnigh his end
called his two eldest children to his side

<|endoftext|>

from square to square with tiger leaps panted the lustful fire
the air to leeward shuddered with the gasps of its desire
and church and palace which even now stood whelmed but to the knee
<|endoftext|>

and as the tower came crashing down the bells in clear accord
pealed forth the grand old german hymn 'all good souls praise the
lord
<|endoftext|>

and heard the clash of steel on steel
where man faced man in deadly wrath
while clanged the tocsin's hurrying peal
<|endoftext|>

then marked i how each germ of truth
which through the dotard's fingers ran
was mated with a dragon's tooth
<|endoftext|>

the bit of clay for whose delight
you grasp is mortgaged too death might
foreclose this very day in dust

nestling close to thy branches in slumber

how far are ye from those
yet who believes
that ye can shut out heaven
<|endoftext|>

your souls partake its influence not in vain
nor all unconscious as that silent lane
its drift of noiseless apple-blooms receives
<|endoftext|>

so from my feet the dust
of the proud world i shook
then came dear love and shared with me his crust
<|endoftext|>

what visionary tints the year puts on
when falling leaves falter through motionless air
or humbly cling and shiver to be gone
<|endoftext|>

how fuse and mix with what unfelt degrees
clasped by the faint horizon's languid arms
each into each the hazy distances

i see him trace the wayward brook
amid the forest mysteries
where at their shades shy aspens look
<|endoftext|>

on saint helen's granite weak
hark the vulture whets his beak
spin spin clotho spin
<|endoftext|>

'the earth ' they murmur 'is the tomb
that vainly sought his life to prison
why grovel longer in the gloom
<|endoftext|>

spurn you more wealth than can be told
the fowl that lays the eggs of gold
because she's plainly clad man
<|endoftext|>

the lessons of life we forget
while a trifle a trick of color
in the wonderful web is set
<|endoftext|>

'these buttercups shall brim with wine
beyond all lesbian juice or massic
may not new england be divine
<|endoftext|>

and yet could i live it over
this life that stirs in my brain
could i be both maiden and lover
<|endoftext|>

then all was silent till there smote my ear
a movement in the stream that checked my breath
was it the slow plash of a wading deer
<|endoftext|>

when empires must be wound we bring the shroud
the time-old web of the implacable three
is it too coarse for him the young and proud
<|endoftext|>

hath he the many's plaudits found more sweet
than wisdom
held opinion's wind for law
<|endoftext|>

'time was unlocks the riddle of time is
that offers choice of glory or of gloom
the solver makes time shall be surely his
<|endoftext|>

but hasten sisters
for even now the tomb
grates its slow hinge and calls from the abyss
<|endoftext|>

'god give us peace
not such as lulls to sleep
but sword on thigh and brow with purpose knit
<|endoftext|>

and let our ship of state to harbor sweep
her ports all up her battle-lanterns lit
and her leashed thunders gathering for their leap
<|endoftext|>

you think her old ribs have come all crashing through
if a whisk of fate's broom snap your cobweb asunder
but her rivets were clinched by a wiser than you
<|endoftext|>

i write of one
while with dim eyes i think of three
who weeps not others fair and brave as he
<|endoftext|>

i know not how it is with other men
whom i but guess deciphering myself
for me once felt is so felt nevermore
<|endoftext|>

so when our fancy seeks analogies
though she have hidden what she after finds
she loves to cheat herself with feigned surprise
<|endoftext|>

i went and with the saxon's pious care
first ordered dinner at the pea-green inn
the flies and i its only customers
<|endoftext|>

eluding these i loitered through the town
with hope to take my minster unawares
in its grave solitude of memory
<|endoftext|>

with one long sigh of infinite release
from pedantries past present or to come
i looked and owned myself a happy goth
<|endoftext|>

shall he divine no strength unmade of votes
inward impregnable found soon as sought
not cognizable of sense o'er sense supreme
<|endoftext|>

in household faces waiting at the door
their evening step should lighten up no more
in fields their boyish feet had known
<|endoftext|>

in trees their fathers' hands had set
and which with them had grown
widening each year their leafy coronet
<|endoftext|>

the winged years that winnow praise and blame
blow many names out: they but fan to flame
the self-renewing splendors of thy fame
<|endoftext|>

that soul so softly radiant and so white
the track it left seems less of fire than light
cold but to such as love distemperature
<|endoftext|>

and if pure light as some deem be the force
that drives rejoicing planets on their course
why for his power benign seek an impurer source
<|endoftext|>

who sit where once in crowned seclusion sate
the long-proved athletes of debate
trained from their youth as none thinks needful now
<|endoftext|>

natures benignly mixed of air and earth
now with the stars and now with equal zest
tracing the eccentric orbit of a jest
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

the birds are hushed the poets gone
where no harsh critic's lash can reach
to all who love our english speech
<|endoftext|>

fit rosary for a queen in shape and hue
when contemplation tells her pensive beads
of mortal thoughts forever old and new
<|endoftext|>

thanks for a pleasure that can never pall
a serene moment deftly caught and kept
to make immortal summer on my wall
<|endoftext|>

why should i seek her spell to decompose
or to its source each rill of influence trace
that feeds the brimming river of her grace
<|endoftext|>

was i then more than mortal made
or she
less than divine that she might mate with me
<|endoftext|>

why spend on me a poor earth-delving mole
the fireside sweetnesses the heavenward lift
the hourly mercy of a woman's soul
<|endoftext|>

come sunshine's treasurer and bring
to doubting flowers their faith in spring
to birds and me the need to sing
<|endoftext|>

light of those eyes that made the light of mine
where shine you
on what happier fields and flowers
<|endoftext|>

pure as dian's forehead bare
yet suffused with warmer hue
such as only latmos knew
<|endoftext|>

oft round my hall of portraiture i gaze
by memory reared the artist wise and holy
from stainless quarries of deep-buried days
<|endoftext|>

ah never master that drew mortal breath
can match thy portraits just and generous death
whose brush with sweet regretful tints is laden
<|endoftext|>

i was with thee in heaven: i cannot tell
if years or moments so the sudden bliss
when first we found then lost us in a kiss
<|endoftext|>

this morn 'twas may the blossoms were astir
with southern wind but now the boughs are bent
with snow instead of birds and all things freeze
<|endoftext|>

how much of all my past is dumb with her
and of my future too for with her went
half of that world i ever cared to please
<|endoftext|>

grim jest of fate
yet who dare call it blind
knowing what life is what our human-kind
<|endoftext|>

in charmed communion with his dual mind
he wandered spain himself both knight and hind
redressing wrongs he knew must ever be
<|endoftext|>

what mean these banners spread
these paths with royal red
so gaily carpeted
<|endoftext|>

'tis striking six
sure never day
was short as this is
<|endoftext|>

perfect
and all this to waste
on a graybeard's palsied taste
<|endoftext|>

earth grew dim
and wavered in a golden mist
as rose not paper leaves i kissed
<|endoftext|>

donne you forgive
i let you keep
her precious comment poet deep
<|endoftext|>

easy as loving easy as kissing
easy as well let me ponder as missing
known since the world was by scarce two or three
<|endoftext|>

a juice to make rock-candy of but then
we get such weather scarce one year in ten

i've known the fellow for years
my button i've wrenched from his clutch man
i shudder whenever he nears
<|endoftext|>

'hee-haw
' cried he 'i hearken ' as who knew
for such ear-largess humble thanks were due
<|endoftext|>

who tunnels bring not cisterns for my lay
none but his peers the poet rightly hear
nor mete we listeners by their length of ear
<|endoftext|>

swiftly the politic goes: is it dark
he borrows a lantern
slowly the statesman and sure guiding his steps by the stars
<|endoftext|>

and with commissioned talons wrench
from thy supplanter's grimy clench
his sheath of steel his wings of smoke and flame
<|endoftext|>

more than when first i singled thee
this only prayer is mine
that in the years i yet shall see
<|endoftext|>

nay shudder not
i should bestow it
so brimming full she couldn't blow it
<|endoftext|>

'tis possible to climb
to kindle or to slake
although in skelton's rhyme

critics are ever likely to be

long ago long ago

some for the flag they lived and died

but a lad there was to his fellows sang

i saw her first abreast the boston light
at anchor she had just come in turned head
and sent her hawsers creaking clattering down
<|endoftext|>

there in smoke-smudged coats
lay funnelled liners dirty fishing-craft
blunt cargo-luggers tugs and ferry-boats
<|endoftext|>

often i think of you jimmy doane
you who light-heartedly came to my house
three autumns to shoot and to eat a grouse
<|endoftext|>

as i sat apart in this quiet room
my mind was full of the horror of war
and not with the hope of a visitor
<|endoftext|>

i had dined on food that had lost its taste
my soul was cold and i wished you were here
when all in a moment i knew you were near
<|endoftext|>

placing that chair where you used to sit
i looked at my book: three years to-day
since you laughed in that seat and i heard you say
<|endoftext|>

my country is with you whatever befall
america britain these two are akin
in courage and honour they underpin
<|endoftext|>

you were comely and tall you had corded arms
and sympathy's grace with your strength was blent
you were generous clever and confident
<|endoftext|>

there was that in your hopes which uncountable lives
have perished to make your heart was fulfilled
with the breath of god that can never be stilled
<|endoftext|>

a living symbol of power you talked
of the work to do in the world to make
life beautiful: yes and my heartstrings ache
<|endoftext|>

to think how you at the stroke of war
chose that your steadfast soul should fly
with the eagles of france as their proud ally
<|endoftext|>

you were america's self dear lad
the first swift son of your bright free land
to heed the call of the inner command
<|endoftext|>

to image its spirit in such rare deeds
as braced the valour of france who knows
that the heart of america thrills with her woes
<|endoftext|>

brave man is its flower and symbol who
makes bold to utter the words that choke
the throats of feebler timider folk
<|endoftext|>

you flew for the western eagle and fell
doing great things for your country's pride
for the beauty and peace of life you died
<|endoftext|>

britain and france have shrined in their souls
your memory yes and for ever you share
their love with their perished lords of the air
<|endoftext|>

invisible now in that empty seat
you sit who came through the clouds to me
swift as a message from over the sea
<|endoftext|>

my house is always open to you
dear spirit come often and you will find
welcome where mind can foregather with mind
<|endoftext|>

and may we sit together one day
quietly here when a word is said
to bring new gladness unto our dead
<|endoftext|>

knowing your dream is a dream no more
and seeing on some momentous pact
your vision upbuilt as a deathless fact

from cot and town and plough and moor

there is dust in my eyes for i cannot see

soldier of france
<|endoftext|>

she said: now have i stayed too long in this my place of bliss
with these glad dead that comforted forget what sorrow is
upon that world whose stony stairs they climbed to come to this
<|endoftext|>

but lo a cry hath torn the peace wherein so long i stayed
like a trumpet's call at heaven's wall from a herald unafraid
a million voices in one cry 'where is the maid the maid
<|endoftext|>

i had forgot from too much joy that olden task of mine
but i have heard a certain word shatter the chant divine
have watched a banner glow and grow before mine eyes for sign
<|endoftext|>

i would return to that my land flung in the teeth of war
i would cast down my robe and crown that pleasure me no more
and don the armor that i knew the valiant sword i bore
<|endoftext|>

and angels militant shall fling the gates of heaven wide
and souls new-dead whose lives were shed like leaves on war's red tide
shall cross their swords above our heads and cheer us as we ride
<|endoftext|>

for with me goes that soldier saint saint michael of the sword
and i shall ride on his right side a page beside his lord
and men shall follow like swift blades to reap a sure reward
<|endoftext|>

grant that i answer this my call yea though the end may be
the naked shame the biting flame the last long agony
i would go singing down that road where fagots wait for me

<|endoftext|>

and we who deemed him wise
we who believed that thou wast dead
how should we seek thine eyes
<|endoftext|>

let us fight fair for our own best or worst
so gentlemen of the guard
fire first
<|endoftext|>

relentless savage hot and grim the infuriate columns press
where terror simulates disdain and danger is largess
where greedy youth claims death for bride and agony seems bliss
<|endoftext|>

ride cossacks ride
charge turcos charge
the fateful hour has come
<|endoftext|>

the superman has burst his bonds
with kultur-flag unfurled
and prayer on lip he runs amuck imperilling the world
<|endoftext|>

and shut the strife in darkness: all was still
then slowly crept a triumph on the dark
and i heard beauty singing up the hill
<|endoftext|>

i have heard the townsfolk come
i have heard the roll and thunder of the nearest drum
as the drummer stopped and cried hear
<|endoftext|>

be strong
the summons comes
prepare
<|endoftext|>

and there was calm in my heart of the desert of the dead sea
of vast plains of the west before the coming storm
and there was calm in their eyes like the last calm that shall be
<|endoftext|>

they seem to be walking in dreams
they seem not to know
it is their homes their happiness vanishing so
<|endoftext|>

they sang an old war-song
i have heard it often in other days
but never before when war was walking the world's highways
<|endoftext|>

half a thousand dead men soon shall hear and see
we're a band
said the weary big dragoon
<|endoftext|>

and if he sees as clearly
as i do where her shrine
must fall he longs as dearly
<|endoftext|>

it's a cot and a hospital ward for me
but i'll tell 'em in blighty wherever i be
how the guards came through
<|endoftext|>

but here you are at last and the sight is good for our eyes
glad to welcome you up and out of the caves of the sea
and ready for sale or barter whatever your will may be
<|endoftext|>

the captain of the submersible
oh do not be impatient good friends of this neutral land
that we have been so tardy in reaching your eager strand
<|endoftext|>

they chose and the women and children that are greeting you here are
those
ghosts of the women and children that the rest of the hundred chose
<|endoftext|>

come come get down to business
for time is money you know
and you must make up in both to us for having been so slow
<|endoftext|>

deal as you will with me
this is my choice to the end
to live in the life i vowed
<|endoftext|>

and sweetness filled her brave
with a vision of understanding beyond the hour
that knelled to the waiting grave
<|endoftext|>

a mitrailleuse battery planted on top of this well-chosen ridge
held the road for the prussians and covered the direct approach to the
bridge
<|endoftext|>

will he live will he last will he make it
and so near to the
goal
<|endoftext|>

god of battles look down and protect him
lord his heart is as thine
let him live
<|endoftext|>

and i thought of my beautiful paris and gave a last look at the land
at france my belle france in her glory of blue sky and green field
and wood
<|endoftext|>

death with honor but never surrender
and to die with such men it was
good
<|endoftext|>

and poured them molten from thy tragic towers
now are the windows dust that were thy flower
patterned like frost petalled like asphodels
<|endoftext|>

full sixty yards i've seen them throw
with all that nicety of aim
they learned on british cricket-fields
<|endoftext|>

shouts back the sound of mirth
tramp of feet and lilt of song
ringing all the road along
<|endoftext|>

when cheeks are flushed and glasses gilt and pearled
with the sweet wine of france that concentrates
the sunshine and the beauty of the world
<|endoftext|>

o the fading eyes the grimed face turned bony
oped mouth gushing fallen head
lessening pressure of a hand shrunk clammed and stony
<|endoftext|>

we are here in a wood of little beeches
and the leaves are like black lace
against a sky of nacre
<|endoftext|>

goaded like the damned by some invisible wrath
a will stronger than weariness stronger than animal fear
implacable and monotonous
<|endoftext|>

almost at unawares savagely and strewn
in bloody fragments to be the carrion
of rats and crows
<|endoftext|>

choked with wild weeds and overgrown
with rank grass all torn and rent
by war's opposing engines strewn
<|endoftext|>

not only unto thee across the narrow sea
but from the loneliest vale in the last land's heart
the sad-eyed watching mother sees her sons depart
<|endoftext|>

the glass is dim we see not wisely far nor well
but bred of english bone and reared on freedom's wine
all that we have and are we lay on england's shrine
<|endoftext|>

the sentry stands his limbs with cold congealed
his head a-nod with sleep he cannot yield
though sleep and snow in deadly force unite
<|endoftext|>

the soil of france
fat fields and green that bred my
blood and bone
<|endoftext|>

with these we hold in soul and heart
with these we choose our lot and part
till liberty is safe on sea and shore
<|endoftext|>

the fresh cold wind of dawn blows on my face
as in the sun's raw heart i swiftly fly
and watch the seas glide by
<|endoftext|>

oh down by millwall basin as i went the other day
i met a skipper that i knew and to him i did say
now what's the cargo captain that brings you up this way
<|endoftext|>

and if it's sweeping mines
or hanging out with booby-traps for the skulking submarines
i'm here to do my blooming best and give the beggars beans
<|endoftext|>

a rough job and a tough job is the best job for me
and what or where i don't much care i'll take what it may be
for a tight place is the right place when it's foul weather at sea
<|endoftext|>

what matter
on the winning of a goal
you staked your soul
<|endoftext|>

perhaps 't was pluck
that hardened him a man among the men
perhaps
<|endoftext|>

hell
but one was hit
and tumbling like a pigeon plump
<|endoftext|>

as we ebbed with the battle-tide
fingers of red-hot steel
suddenly closed on my side
<|endoftext|>

i crawled on my hands and lay
where a shallow crater yawned wide
then i swooned
<|endoftext|>

his words i already foreknew
these are old wounds said he
but of late they have troubled me
<|endoftext|>

the wounded canadian speaks
my leg
it's off at the knee
<|endoftext|>

i'm gay
you bet i am gay
but i wasn't a while ago
<|endoftext|>

what has happened since then
since i lay with my face to the wall
the most despairing of men
<|endoftext|>

so over the blanket's rim
i raised my terrible face
and i saw how i envied him
<|endoftext|>

then i stopped for lo
she was there
and a great light shone in her eyes
<|endoftext|>

they sent him back to her
the letter came
saying
<|endoftext|>

wasn't she glad now
everything seemed won
and all the rest for them permissible ease
<|endoftext|>

blow bugles blow
they brought us for our dearth
holiness lacked so long and love and pain
<|endoftext|>

the years had given them kindness
dawn was theirs
and sunset and the colours of the earth
<|endoftext|>

and your bright promise withered long and sped
is touched stirs rises opens and grows sweet
and blossoms and is you when you are dead
<|endoftext|>

not one of these poor men who died
but did within his soul believe
that death for thee was glorified
<|endoftext|>

so young they were so strong and well
until the bitter summons fell
too young to die
<|endoftext|>

so beautiful their bodies were
built with so exquisite a care
so young and fit and lithe and fair
<|endoftext|>

yet now so pitiful they lie
where love of country bade them hie
to fight this fierce caprice and die
<|endoftext|>

we can but give our tears
ye dead men who shall bring you
fame in the coming years
<|endoftext|>

back from the trenches more dead than alive
stone-deaf and dazed and with a broken knee
he hobbled slowly muttering vacantly
<|endoftext|>

we fell we lay we slumbered we took rest
with the wild nerves quiet at last and the vexed brain
freed of the heavy dreams of hearts afar
<|endoftext|>

and what do you call it
asked one
i thought i was dead
<|endoftext|>

and over the wide field friend and foe
spoke of small things remembering not old woe
of war and hunger hatred and fierce words
<|endoftext|>

they sat and listened to the brooks and birds
and watched the starlight perish in pale flame
wondering what god would look like when he came
<|endoftext|>

we laughed and paid the forfeit glad to pay
being recompensed beyond our sacrifice
with that nor death nor time can take away
<|endoftext|>

but wherever they lie an english rose
so red and a lily of france so pale
will grow for a love that never and never can fail
<|endoftext|>

yes so we called you then
you far more wise
than to give life to men
<|endoftext|>

look look down
and gather the blinded oceans
moon of compassion
<|endoftext|>

light of light grant them eternal peace
and let light perpetual shine upon them
light everlasting
<|endoftext|>

in flooded trench half numb to cold or pain
or marching through the desert sand
to some dread place that they may never gain
<|endoftext|>

though death may lurk in any tree or hill
his brave young spirit is their stay
trusting in that they'll follow where he will
<|endoftext|>

your son and my son the downy things
sheltered in mother's breast by mother's wings
should they be broken in the lord's wars peace
<|endoftext|>

dead by the russian lance
dead in southern mountains
dead through the farms of france
<|endoftext|>

some heard some fled
it must be
some slept for they never woke
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

under our curtain of fire
under the tow-path past the barges
unflinching hero watchful to foresee
<|endoftext|>

ye sleepers who will sing you
you dare to say with perjured lips
you have become a forge of snow-white fire
<|endoftext|>

yes truly it is a great thing for a nation that it get an articulate
voice that it produce a man who will speak forth melodiously what the
heart of it means
<|endoftext|>

i conned old times
i sat studying at the feet of the great masters
now if eligible o that the great masters might return and study me
<|endoftext|>

the soul
for ever and for ever longer than soil is brown and solid longer than
water ebbs and flows
<|endoftext|>

each is not for its own sake
i say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's
sake
<|endoftext|>

for you to share with me two greatnesses and a third one rising
inclusive and more resplendent
the greatness of love and democracy and the greatness of religion
<|endoftext|>

o strain musical flowing through ages now reaching hither
i take to your reckless and composite chords i add to them and cheerfully
pass them forward
<|endoftext|>

i will make the true poem of riches
to earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and
is not dropped by death
<|endoftext|>

land of coal and iron
land of gold
lands of cotton sugar rice
<|endoftext|>

land of the pastoral plains the grass-fields of the world
land of those
sweet-aired interminable plateaus
<|endoftext|>

inextricable lands
the clutched together
the passionate ones
<|endoftext|>

the side by side
the elder and younger brothers
the bony-limbed
<|endoftext|>

the pennsylvanian
the virginian
the double carolinian
<|endoftext|>

on my way a moment i pause
here for you
and here for america
<|endoftext|>

still the present i raise aloft still the future of the states i harbinge
glad and sublime
and for the past i pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines
<|endoftext|>

always california's golden hills and hollows and the silver mountains of
new mexico
always soft-breathed cuba
<|endoftext|>

i see freedom completely armed and victorious and very haughty with law
by her side both issuing forth against the idea of caste
what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach
<|endoftext|>

come closer to me
push close my lovers and take the best i possess
yield closer and closer and give me the best you possess
<|endoftext|>

male and female
i pass so poorly with paper and types i must pass with the contact of
bodies and souls
<|endoftext|>

grown half-grown and babe of this country and every country indoors and
outdoors one just as much as the other i see
and all else behind or through them
<|endoftext|>

the wife and she is not one jot less than the husband
the daughter and she is just as good as the son
the mother and she is every bit as much as the father
<|endoftext|>

have you reckoned them for a trade or farm-work
or for the profits of a
store
<|endoftext|>

or to achieve yourself a position
or to fill a gentleman's leisure or a
lady's leisure
<|endoftext|>

can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass
is there
nothing greater or more
<|endoftext|>

the great city is that which has the greatest man or woman
if it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the
whole world
<|endoftext|>

i see the european headsman
he stands masked clothed in red with huge legs and strong naked arms
and leans on a ponderous axe
<|endoftext|>

america
i do not vaunt my love for you
i have what i have
<|endoftext|>

as for me
i have the idea of all and am all and believe in all
i believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true i reject no part
<|endoftext|>

i behold the mariners of the world
some are in storms some in the night with the watch on the look-out
some drifting helplessly some with contagious diseases
<|endoftext|>

i see the electric telegraphs of the earth
i see the filaments of the news of the wars deaths losses gains
passions of my race
<|endoftext|>

i see the battlefields of the earth grass grows upon them and blossoms
and corn
i see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions
<|endoftext|>

you working-man of the rhine the elbe or the weser
you working-woman
too
<|endoftext|>

you japanese man or woman
you liver in madagascar ceylon sumatra
borneo
<|endoftext|>

you benighted roamer of amazonia
you patagonian
you fejee-man
<|endoftext|>

i do not prefer others so very much before you either
i do not say one word against you away back there where you stand
you will come forward in due time to my side
<|endoftext|>

i have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run through
i have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas and on the highest
embedded rocks to cry thence
<|endoftext|>

what cities the light or warmth penetrates i penetrate those cities
myself
all islands to which birds wing their way i wing my way myself
<|endoftext|>

see my cantabile
these and more are flashing to us from the procession
as it moves changing a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before us
<|endoftext|>

they are justified they are accomplished they shall now be turned the
other way also to travel toward you thence
they shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake libertad
<|endoftext|>

i love to look on the stars and stripes i hope the fifes will play yankee
doodle
how bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops
<|endoftext|>

what troubles you yankee phantoms
what is all this chattering of bare
gums
<|endoftext|>

does the ague convulse your limbs
do you mistake your crutches for
firelocks and level them
<|endoftext|>

if you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the president's
marshal
if you groan such groans you might baulk the government cannon
<|endoftext|>

worse and worse
can't you stand it
are you retreating
<|endoftext|>

to your graves
back
back to the hills old limpers
<|endoftext|>

i will whisper it to the mayor he shall send a committee to england
they shall get a grant from the parliament go with a cart to the royal
vault haste
<|endoftext|>

you have got your revenge old bluster
the crown is come to its own and
more than its own
<|endoftext|>

stick your hands in your pockets jonathan you are a made man from this
day
you are mighty 'cute and here is one of your bargains
<|endoftext|>

a great year and place
a harsh discordant natal scream out-sounding to touch the mother's heart
closer than any yet
<|endoftext|>

not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom in its
turn to bear seed
which the winds carry afar and resow and the rains and the snows nourish
<|endoftext|>

not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose
but it stalks invisibly over the earth whispering counselling
cautioning
<|endoftext|>

then courage
revolter
revoltress
<|endoftext|>

from the houses then and the workshops and through all the doorways
leaped they tumultuous and lo
manhattan arming
<|endoftext|>

how i love them
how i could hug them with their brown faces and their
clothes and knapsacks covered with dust
<|endoftext|>

often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frowned amid all
your children
but now you smile with joy exulting old mannahatta
<|endoftext|>

how the true thunder bellows after the lightning
how bright the flashes of
lightning
<|endoftext|>

thunder on
stride on democracy
strike with vengeful stroke
<|endoftext|>

crash heavier heavier yet o storms
you have done me good
my soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment
<|endoftext|>

words
book-words
what are you
<|endoftext|>

words no more for hearken and see
my song is there in the open air and i must sing
with the banner and pennant a-flapping
<|endoftext|>

o it stretches it spreads and runs so fast
o my father
it is so broad it covers the whole sky
<|endoftext|>

i hear and see not strips of cloth alone
i hear the tramp of armies i hear the challenging sentry
i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men i hear liberty
<|endoftext|>

o to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers
flag like a beautiful
woman
<|endoftext|>

o to hear the tramp tramp of a million answering men
o the ships they
arm with joy
<|endoftext|>

i dress a wound in the side deep deep
but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking
and the yellow-blue countenance see
<|endoftext|>

above all lo the sky so calm so transparent after the rain and with
wondrous clouds
below too all calm all vital and beautiful and the farm prospers well
<|endoftext|>

down in the fields all prospers well
but now from the fields come father come at the daughter's call
and come to the entry mother to the front door come right away
<|endoftext|>

open the envelope quickly
o this is not our son's writing yet his name is signed
o a strange hand writes for our dear son o stricken mother's soul
<|endoftext|>

o years and graves
o air and soil
o my dead an aroma sweet
<|endoftext|>

up from the east the silvery round moon
beautiful over the house-tops ghastly phantom moon
immense and silent moon
<|endoftext|>

the soul yourself i see great as any good as the best
waiting secure and content which the bullet could never kill
nor the bayonet stab o friend
<|endoftext|>

nor the long roll alarming the camp nor even the muffled beat for a
burial
nothing from you this time o drummers bearing my warlike drums
<|endoftext|>

invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions
follow me ever
desert me not while i live
<|endoftext|>

sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living sweet are the musical voices
sounding
but sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eyes
<|endoftext|>

dearest comrades
all now is over
but love is not over and what love o comrades
<|endoftext|>

o love
o chant
solve all with the last chemistry
<|endoftext|>

give me exhaustless make me a fountain
that i exhale love from me wherever i go
for the sake of all dead soldiers
<|endoftext|>

all night long on the prong of a moss-scalloped stake
down almost amid the slapping waves
sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears
<|endoftext|>

_soothe
soothe
soothe
<|endoftext|>

close on its wave soothes the wave behind
and again another behind embracing and lapping every one close
but my love soothes not me not me
<|endoftext|>

loud
loud
loud
<|endoftext|>

that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice
that is the fluttering the flattering of the spray
those are the shadows of leaves
<|endoftext|>

o past
o life
o songs of joy
<|endoftext|>

demon or bird
is it indeed toward your mate you sing
or is it mostly to me
<|endoftext|>

o i cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me
o vapour a look a word
o well-beloved
<|endoftext|>

sound out voices of young men
loudly and musically call me by my nighest
name
<|endoftext|>

you have waited you always wait you dumb beautiful ministers
you
novices
<|endoftext|>

how plenteous
how spiritual
how resume
<|endoftext|>

elemental drifts
o i wish i could impress others as you and the waves have just been
impressing me
<|endoftext|>

these you presented to me you fish-shaped island
as i wended the shores i know
as i walked with that eternal self of me seeking types
<|endoftext|>

i perceive nature here in sight of the sea is taking advantage of me to
dart upon me and sting me
because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all
<|endoftext|>

you oceans both
i close with you
these little shreds shall indeed stand for all
<|endoftext|>

you fish-shaped island
i take what is underfoot
what is yours is mine my father
<|endoftext|>

i throw myself upon your breast my father
i cling to you so that you cannot unloose me
i hold you so firm till you answer me something
<|endoftext|>

i mean tenderly by you
i gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead and
following me and mine
<|endoftext|>

the great laws take and effuse without argument
i am of the same style for i am their friend
i love them quits and quits i do not halt and make salaams
<|endoftext|>

i lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of
things
they are so beautiful i nudge myself to listen
<|endoftext|>

realism is mine my miracles take freely
take without end i offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you or
your eyes reach
<|endoftext|>

of detected persons to me detected persons are not in any respect worse
than undetected persons and are not in any respect worse than i am
myself
<|endoftext|>

as i lay with my head in your lap camerado
the confession i made i resume what i said to you and the open air i
resume
<|endoftext|>

to speak
to walk
to seize something by the hand
<|endoftext|>

o setting sun
though the time has come
i still warble under you unmitigated adoration
<|endoftext|>

when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes and the victories of mighty
generals i do not envy the generals
nor the president in his presidency nor the rich in his great house
<|endoftext|>

when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed
and the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night
i mourned
<|endoftext|>

solitary the thrush
the hermit withdrawn to himself avoiding the settlements
sings by himself a song
<|endoftext|>

lo
body and soul
this land
<|endoftext|>

from deep secluded recesses
from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still
came the singing of the bird
<|endoftext|>

and the charm of the singing rapt me
as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night
and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird
<|endoftext|>

when it is so when thou hast taken them i joyously sing the dead
lost in the loving floating ocean of thee
laved in the flood of thy bliss o death
<|endoftext|>

to the tally of my soul
loud and strong kept up the grey-brown bird
with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night
<|endoftext|>

loud in the pines and cedars dim
clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume
and i with my comrades there in the night
<|endoftext|>

i saw battle-corpses myriads of them
and the white skeletons of young men i saw them
i saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers
<|endoftext|>

must i pass from my song for thee
from my gaze on thee in the west fronting the west communing with thee
o comrade lustrous with silver face in the night
<|endoftext|>

o captain
my captain
our fearful trip is done
<|endoftext|>

but o heart
heart
heart
<|endoftext|>

leave you not the little spot
where on the deck my captain lies
fallen cold and dead
<|endoftext|>

o captain
my captain
rise up and hear the bells
<|endoftext|>

but i with silent tread
walk the spot my captain lies
fallen cold and dead
<|endoftext|>

for we cannot tarry here
we must march my darlings we must bear the brunt of danger
we the youthful sinewy races all the rest on us depend
<|endoftext|>

we take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

o i mourn and yet exult i am rapt with love for all
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

then upon the march we fittest die soon and sure the gap is filled
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

never must you be divided in our ranks you move united
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

soon i hear you coming warbling soon you rise and tramp amid us
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

still be ours the diet hard and the blanket on the ground
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

was the road of late so toilsome
did we stop discouraged nodding on our
way
<|endoftext|>

yet a passing hour i yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious
pioneers
o pioneers
<|endoftext|>

were you thinking that those were the words those upright lines
those
curves angles dots
<|endoftext|>

no those are not the words the substantial words are in the ground and
sea
they are in the air they are in you
<|endoftext|>

were you thinking that those were the words those delicious sounds out of
your friends' mouths
no the real words are more delicious than they
<|endoftext|>

the workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth
the great masters know the earth's words and use them more than the
audible words
<|endoftext|>

whoever you are
motion and reflection are especially for you
the divine ship sails the divine sea for you
<|endoftext|>

each man to himself and each woman to herself such as the word of the
past and present and the word of immortality
no one can acquire for another not one
<|endoftext|>

the song is to the singer and comes back most to him
the teaching is to the teacher and comes back most to him
the murder is to the murderer and comes back most to him
<|endoftext|>

this is a poem for the sayers of words these are hints of meanings
these are they that echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls
if they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they then
<|endoftext|>

delve

i see the ships
the vast factories with their foremen and workmen

<|endoftext|>

they stand for realities all is as it should be

death in whose service is nothing of gladness takes
me

see how the stars are tossed
distorted the brightest lost

there did you see
that spark fly up at us even
stars are not safe in heaven
<|endoftext|>

a come and go of march-day loves
through the flower-vine trailing screen
a fluttering in of doves
<|endoftext|>

fluent active figures of men pass along the railway
and i am woken
from the dreams that the distance flattered
<|endoftext|>

you are always asking do i remember remember
the butter-cup bog-end where the flowers rose up
and kindled you over deep with a cast of gold
<|endoftext|>

you ask again do the healing days close up
the open darkness which then drew us in
the dark which then drank up our brimming cup
<|endoftext|>

and yes thank god it still is possible
the healing days shall close the darkness up
wherein we fainted like a smoke or dew

from your body's terrors and dross

'tis the sun who asks the question in a lovely haste

and oh behind the cloud-sheaves like yellow autumn

did you see the wicked sun that winked
<|endoftext|>

i have fetched the tears up out of the little wells
scooped them up with small iron words
dripping over the runnels
<|endoftext|>

the harsh cold wind of my words drove on and still
i watched the tears on the guilty cheek of the boys
glitter and spill
<|endoftext|>

if i could have put you in my heart
if but i could have wrapped you in myself
how glad i should have been
<|endoftext|>

and oh that you had never never been
some of your selves my love that some
of your several faces i had never seen
<|endoftext|>

nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her
dreams
of perfect things
<|endoftext|>

she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream
and her dead mouth sings
by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings
<|endoftext|>

two and two are the folk that walk
they pass in a half embrace
with dark face leaning to face
<|endoftext|>

so i am not lonely nor sad
although bereaved of you
my little love
<|endoftext|>

i move among a kinsfolk clad
with words but the dream shows through
as they move
<|endoftext|>

earth of my swaying atmosphere
substance of my inconstant breath
i cannot but cleave to you
<|endoftext|>

your presence peering lonelily there
oppresses me so i can hardly bear
to share the train with you
<|endoftext|>

yet closely bitten in to me
is this armour of stiff reluctancy
that keeps me impounded
<|endoftext|>

for i ache most earnestly for your touch
yet i cannot move however much
i would be your lover
<|endoftext|>

will you open the amorous aching bud
of my body and loose the burning flood
that would leap to you from my heart
<|endoftext|>

she clung to the door in her haste to enter
entered and quickly cast
it shut behind her leaving the street aghast
<|endoftext|>

oh let us here forget let us take the sheer
unknown that lies before us bearing the ark
of the covenant onwards where she cannot go
<|endoftext|>

do i not know the darkness within them
what
are they but shrouds
<|endoftext|>

runs like a fretted arc-lamp into light
stirred by conflict to shining which else
were dark and whole with the night
<|endoftext|>

runs to a fret of speed like a racing wheel
which else were aslumber along with the whole
of the dark swinging rhythmic instead of a-reel
<|endoftext|>

leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping
in a jet from out of obscurity
which erst was darkness sleeping
<|endoftext|>

runs into streams of bright blue drops
water and stones and stars and myriads
of twin-blue eyes and crops
<|endoftext|>

of floury grain and all the hosts of day
all lovely hosts of ripples caused by fretting
the darkness into play
<|endoftext|>

then suddenly she looked up
and i was blind in a tawny-gold day
till she took her eyes away
<|endoftext|>

so i held my heart aloft
to the cuckoo that hung like a dove
and she settled soft
<|endoftext|>

i echoed with surprise
hearing my mere lips shout
the answer they did devise
<|endoftext|>

mournfully to and fro to and fro the trees are
waving
what did you say my dear
<|endoftext|>

one lonely bell one only the storm-tossed afternoon
is braving
why not let it ring
<|endoftext|>

a wet bird walks on the lawn call to the boy to come
and look
yes it is over now
<|endoftext|>

he cannot see it i can never show it him how it
shook
don't disturb him darling
<|endoftext|>

i look at the swaling sunset
and wish i could go also
through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar
<|endoftext|>

then i would turn round
and seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber
i would laugh with joy
<|endoftext|>

out of the darkness fretted sometimes in its sleeping
jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
to sight revealing a secret numberless secrets keeping
<|endoftext|>

sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel
runs into speed like a dream the blue of the steel
showing the rocking darkness now a-reel
<|endoftext|>

and all the manifold blue and joyous eyes
the rainbow arching over in the skies
new sparks of wonder opening in surprise

if rowley's language differs from that of other fifteenth

a miller and son once set out for the fair
to sell a fine ass they had brought up with care
and the way that they started made everyone stare
<|endoftext|>

the miller at once put the brute on the ground
and the ass who had liked to ride t'other way round
complained in language of curious sound
<|endoftext|>

yet this young creature so worked on his mind
that he wanted no woman to call him unkind
and he said to his son: seat yourself here behind
<|endoftext|>

with the ass bearing double they jogged on again
and once more met a critic who said: it is plain
only dunces would give their poor donkey such pain
<|endoftext|>

he will die with their weight: it's a shame and a sin
for their faithful servant they care not a pin
they'll have nothing to sell at the fair but his skin
<|endoftext|>

both father and son now decided to walk
while the ass marched in front with a strut and a stalk
yet the people who passed them continued to talk

<|endoftext|>

to my eyes how delightful
the fan of my beloved is
in complete white
<|endoftext|>

a flying cuckoo
over the heian capital
goes diagonally across the city
<|endoftext|>

evening breeze
water is slapping against
the legs of a blue heron
<|endoftext|>

an old well
jumping at a mosquito
the fish's sound is dark
<|endoftext|>

young bamboo trees
at hashimoto the courtesan
is she still there or not
<|endoftext|>

after having been fallen
its image still stands
the peony flower
<|endoftext|>

summer night ending so soon
with on the river shallows still remains
the moon in a sliver
<|endoftext|>

it penetrates into me
stepping on the comb of my gone wife
in the bedroom
<|endoftext|>

more than last year
i now feel solitude
this autumn twilight
<|endoftext|>

moon in the sky's top
clearly passes through this
poor town street
<|endoftext|>

let myself go to bed
new year's day is only a matter
for tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

a handsaw is sounding
as if from a poor one
at midnight in this winter

old man's love affair
in trying to forget it
a winter rainfall

in an old pond
a straw sandal is sinking

the poems which came from foreign countries
don`t need a visa
just a good translator is enough
<|endoftext|>

o the horseman's and horsewoman's joys
the saddle the gallop the pressure upon the seat the cool gurgling
by the ears and hair
<|endoftext|>

o the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter towering in the arena in
perfect condition conscious of power thirsting to meet his
opponent
<|endoftext|>

o the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul
is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless
floods
<|endoftext|>

o the mother's joys
the watching the endurance the precious love the anguish the
patiently yielded life
<|endoftext|>

o the old manhood of me my joy
my children and grand-children my white hair and beard
my largeness calmness majesty out of the long stretch of my life
<|endoftext|>

o the pleasure with trees
the orchard the forest the oak cedar pine pekan-tree
the honey-locust black-walnut cottonwood and magnolia
<|endoftext|>

o while i live to be the ruler of life not a slave
to meet life as a powerful conqueror
no fumes no ennui no more complaints or scornful criticisms
<|endoftext|>

dusk brings
cheeky possums
scampering loudly through the trees
<|endoftext|>

o those feet i cherish
those feet which bring her to me
on tip-toe when days are dark
<|endoftext|>

living is a labor of hope my love
living is a serious business
like loving you
<|endoftext|>

but hope no longer is enough for me
i no longer want to hear the song
i want to sing it
<|endoftext|>

looking in your eyes
i am drunk with the smell of warm earth
lost in a wheat field among the stalks
<|endoftext|>

your eyes
are like an eternal substance changing endlessly
pits without bottom with flashes of green
<|endoftext|>

then the telephone
was closed down
like pitch darkness
<|endoftext|>

and the young girls they say
are taken in the ruins
and in theater loges
<|endoftext|>

that i do feel upon my cheek the glow
of indignation when beneath the rod
a sable brother writhes in silent woe
<|endoftext|>

thus blest we'll live thus wander on our road
and when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb
our love to glad their bosoms still shall bloom
<|endoftext|>

but may the god of justice bid the wind
whelm that curst bark beneath the mountain wave
and bless with liberty and death the slave
<|endoftext|>

the underground roads
are as the dead prefer them
always tortuous

hercules
had a moment of doubt
<|endoftext|>

leaning out over
the dreadful precipice
one contemptuous tree
<|endoftext|>

to the silver-sanded beaches of the pomeranian shore
and in the town of rambin a little boy and maid
plucked the meadow-flowers together and in the sea-surf played
<|endoftext|>

she will not come she's one of us she's mine
the brown dwarf said
the day is set the cake is baked to-morrow we shall wed
<|endoftext|>

he looked he clasped her in his arms he knew the long-lost one
o lisbeth

hither bring me precious gems the richest in your store
then when we pass the gate of glass you'll take your cap once more
<|endoftext|>

looked o'er the baltic water to the pomeranian coast
and for his worth ennobled and rich beyond compare
count deitrich and his lovely bride dwelt long and happy there
<|endoftext|>

and flies to a high star
where a distant fire is burning
like a page of the iliad
<|endoftext|>

i am not yet born o hear me
let not the bloodsucking bat or the rat or the stoat or the
club-footed ghoul come near me

all the christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves and i plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever i can find
in goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea and out come mrs

years and years ago when i was a boy when there were wolves in wales and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors and we chased with the jawbones of deacons the english and the bears before the motor car before the wheel before the duchess-faced horse when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback it snowed and it snowed
but here a small boy says: it snowed last year too
i made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and i knocked my brother down and then we had tea

coming like stallions they paw with their hooves going they snatch with their teeth
till the bents and the furze and the sand are dragged out and the old-time hurdles are beneath

rose a nurse of ninety years
set his child upon her knee
like summer tempest came her tears
<|endoftext|>

behold we know not anything
i can but trust that good shall fall
and every winter change to spring

i hold it true whate'er befall
i feel it when i sorrow most
than never to have loved at all
<|endoftext|>

and while he whistled long and loud
he heard a fierce mermaiden cry
i see the place where thou wilt lie
<|endoftext|>

my sisters crying  :stay for shame
my father raves of death and wreck
they are all to blame they are all to blame
<|endoftext|>

peace singing under her olive and slurring the days gone by
when the poor are hovell'd and hustled together each sex like swine
when only the ledger lives and when only not all men lie
<|endoftext|>

but what of names
we are together always
all on your knees
<|endoftext|>

there speaks a neighbor through the fences light
with a sweet girl and only bees can hear
the gentlest talking of this kind
<|endoftext|>

and honor rites of our meetings sad
when our speech just as a bud to blossom
is cut by wind the cold and mad

magdalena struggled cried and moaned
piter sank into the stone trance
<|endoftext|>

which had been lighted so early
the snow flakes in their by-falls
shine brighter and more festive-fairly
<|endoftext|>

hail
hail to thee o immovable pain
the young grey-eyed king had been yesterday slain
<|endoftext|>

i don't like flowers - they do remind me often
of funerals of weddings and of balls
their presence on tables for a dinner calls
<|endoftext|>

now you're here but afar in the morn
why of this only one of all pages
had i once bent a corner for long
<|endoftext|>

every time this book opens mere
in the same place and it's very strange
as if years had not passed from that edge
<|endoftext|>

i now stride where none need any more
where just a shadow is the best of mates
from the wild garden waves a wind remote
<|endoftext|>

that is why my dreams as i have found
suddenly would spread such extent out
and lead me after the morning star
<|endoftext|>

i'll come once more
let fences blossom
and pools be clear ones and full
<|endoftext|>

why are you so pale and upset
that's because i today made him crazy
with the sour wine of regret
<|endoftext|>

can't forget
he got out astound
with his mouth distorted by pain
<|endoftext|>

my lips are opened a bit
and breath is fast as if in fever
the date that didn't happen ever
<|endoftext|>

in cloudy darkness the bored crescent-sable
had sent to our room its grim shine
six sets are installed on the white of the table
<|endoftext|>

but still not a single bard said the word
there is no wisdom and no the old
and death is a tale just twice told
<|endoftext|>

and deathly wind cools hearts our own
but peter's-city to all us
will be the sanctified tombstone
<|endoftext|>

don't forget
like a wife of the rebel of old
on the red square i'll wail without end
<|endoftext|>

i was ne'er able to endure such pain
let all that was be with a black cloth muffled
and let the lanterns be got out
<|endoftext|>

and looks strait into my red eyes
and threads with death that's coming fast
the immense blazing star
<|endoftext|>

crucifixion
don't weep for me mother
seeing me in a grave
<|endoftext|>

i wish all of them with their names to be called

they took him up and they laid him down
and they had him into the nearest town

how shall we judge the ways of the lord
that are but steel and fire
<|endoftext|>

there's silent night
a sleeping child is growing
the veil of sadness o'er the world is soaring
<|endoftext|>

i do like this star in heights
such a light to us has brought
is a single drop inside
<|endoftext|>

i do like this star so bright
i can grasp the endlessness
to the earth and to the skies
<|endoftext|>

where statues remember me youthful and blessed
in silence so fragrant amidst limes of kings
i hear: the ship's masts are squeaking in swings
<|endoftext|>

leads me into your quiet gardens' shades
where i afraid of every turn and bough
in full forgetfulness seek for my former trace
<|endoftext|>

oh should i come under an arch enlivened
by your great hand into the holly heaven
to cool at last my so shameful heat
<|endoftext|>

there i'll be blessed - forever and entire
and closing my eye-leads blazed by fire
again obtain my tears' former gift
<|endoftext|>

do you see how happy are they
widows women and maidens
<|endoftext|>

most of all treasures i them both prize

wife will betray you leave once faithful friend
but you learn to enjoy the bliss another
look in a mirror of the polar land
<|endoftext|>

and only by caesar's gates  high on the vault
the baby versed into mysteries mourned
because none of them will be ever returned
<|endoftext|>

only here to breath by these graves and these stones
where composed i once those beautiful songs
of the meeting that's waiting for us
<|endoftext|>

where at first into my waxen-colorless face
you had breathed with fresh air of the distant life's grace
pushing through as the graveyard's green grass
<|endoftext|>

over our cursed heads and we
are flying o'er the abyss awful
through space where none can something see
<|endoftext|>

i wait for you
the years in silence pass
and as the image one i wait for you again
<|endoftext|>

the distance is such bright
and azure is so fine
but i'm afraid that you will change your image yet
<|endoftext|>

there behind your shoulders so quiet
the wings' tremble i feel
pierces me with his look of a fire
<|endoftext|>

and endless battle
we only dream of peace
through blood and dust
<|endoftext|>

in long looks gladness will be here
and quietly our years will pass
in moats will be water clear
<|endoftext|>

i'm ready for this meet belated
i'll stretch my arms to you and sing
for you the bearing from battle
<|endoftext|>

there's a morn demon
he's of gauze and light
like skies is blue his tunic's airy flood
<|endoftext|>

he who left for a cave and a lantern
or for river's back-water forlorn
will be met by the eyes of a painter
<|endoftext|>

and if the stars are void of midday words
i shall myself create them for the worlds
and warmly charm them by the songs of battles
<|endoftext|>

i am a brother to the gulfs and storms
but i will plait into my uniforms
a lily  the blue star of flourishing valleys
<|endoftext|>

that from a star took his name by a chance
when he had said don't fear the lord to us
just try the fruit and be like him immortal
<|endoftext|>

but she is too upset and saddened
and under her skin of a satin
the poisoned blood is now moved
<|endoftext|>

for all this now came repudiation
blind men will smash the gentle deceptive temple
and thoughts will come into my habitation
<|endoftext|>

my dear friend and i have tried to find
my paradise in serfdom of a soul
without hopes or memories or goals
<|endoftext|>

may be in my previous a-being
i've cut the throats of my mom and dad
i have been doomed to suffering like that
<|endoftext|>

the moment fled and next one now hovers
and we wring hands but yet once more miss
we are condemned to miss and miss it over
<|endoftext|>

what they're about a don't know yet
but full of pine in the harmonic set
like easy tears they pour around
<|endoftext|>

their love was so gentle so long and surprising
with pining so deep and zeal like a crazy uprising
but much like foes they shunned their meetings confessions
<|endoftext|>

they left each other in suffering wordless and proud
and only in dreams saw the image beloved farther
death had come and commenced their date in the world that is out
<|endoftext|>

if you are here i want to hear
but mute you look at me severe
and i am silent on my way
<|endoftext|>

what can i do
i haven't a blessing
to please you with my simple tongue
<|endoftext|>

this time about my dear friend
i am beginning my narration
my story will be very sad
<|endoftext|>

such we'll start life at last repose
with hand-in-hand such we'll come both
and our grandsons will bury us
<|endoftext|>

but what is this
he stopped frustrated
went back returned a little later

prince vyazemsky
<|endoftext|>

what do you want else
they agreed
the youth is smart and very sweet
<|endoftext|>

but stories calling for a-giggling
from romulus till present days
his mind held in firsthand a place
<|endoftext|>

how swift his glance could be and gentle
brazen and shy and by a chance
shined with a controlled tear at once
<|endoftext|>

is it not former life of pleasure
when in sweet laziness and shade
my happiest days were slowly led
<|endoftext|>

and then a guitar is in favor
dunya will cry
come into my abode of gold
<|endoftext|>

lord byron with his whim successful
dressed into grim romanticism
even the helpless egoism
<|endoftext|>

i wept then sorely for fear
braiding my hair they wept much
and singing led me to a church
<|endoftext|>

i feel that it will not be easy
because the gentle parnee's times
aren't entertaining more to us
<|endoftext|>

days flow after days  each hour departs
a bit of life  and both you and i
plan a long life but could abruptly die
<|endoftext|>

my dusty staff in the eternal glow
and else o god i bless forever  peace
and bread in stove of another home
<|endoftext|>

i slowly walked back to my home on the beach
taking the bottle along with me
this would be a day i would never forget
<|endoftext|>

and thus am damned to spend these coming years
with shouts of coward
ringing in my ears

you can smile a lot all the time
<|endoftext|>

there is nothing but peace
shown in the scene
until a lone man arrives
<|endoftext|>

he bends over and
removes the underbrush
wipes away the dirt and mud
<|endoftext|>

he gently strokes the
well-worn stone with
obvious pain and love
<|endoftext|>

he walks away unerringly
with purpose and point
to his stride
<|endoftext|>

one last look back
is all he needs as yet
another tear drops
<|endoftext|>

even if i'm not awake
i sense the dawn
of yet another day
<|endoftext|>

i have set my rainbow in the clouds and it shall be a
sign of the covenant between me and the earth

<|endoftext|>

kiss and kill me sweetly slowly
drag the life out of me
drain my soul of all affection of all emotion
<|endoftext|>

it brings a tear
you've grown so much you are beautiful
you fill my life you make it full
<|endoftext|>

the leaves begin their dance
but this time
the stars are watching
<|endoftext|>

at least i think that i do
he climbed so far out on the limb
and secured it there with a bow
<|endoftext|>

then out of the clear blue
something happened i stopped
searching when i first looked at you
<|endoftext|>

i know you will understand when i say
that although the price may be high to pay
you and i will find a way
<|endoftext|>

he knew not what to say
ha sat there smiled and held me till this day
but now i know that life has meaning
<|endoftext|>

i must now go i say to him
i smile at him and so does he
in the glass mirror in front of me
<|endoftext|>

i wish for time
an endless time
so that all i wish should be

i'll give you the moon and the sun

your wet aesthetics give me inspiration
rain in the garden

the lungs full of tiny sharp aches
and the air fluttering helplessly

finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
sermons in stones and good in everything

rain in the morning
soft beginning of the day
inviting stillness

where once the waters of your face
spun to my screws
your dry ghost blows

don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'cos i don't wanna get over you

i shelter from the storm inside of me
it's a peculiar warm
<|endoftext|>

even as fog continues to lie in the valleys
so does ancient sin cling to the low places
the depressions in the world consciousness
<|endoftext|>

although glad for the grain we are
aware of the husk
and winter closes on us like a shroud
<|endoftext|>

every place  every thing  every house today is celebrating
today everything is bright  cheerful  a chimera
today is the feast of spring
<|endoftext|>

fly free and happy beyond birthdays and across forever
and we'll meet now and then when we wish
in the midst of the one celebration that never can end
<|endoftext|>

the sun shines not on us  but in us
the rivers flow not past
but through us
<|endoftext|>

falling leaves
hide the path
so quietly
<|endoftext|>

out-stretched for flight
little wings are brushed
by a hazy summer sun
<|endoftext|>

at sunset we sat
you and me quietly there
breathing in and out
<|endoftext|>

i pray you'll be our eyes and watch us where we go
and help us to be wise in times when we don't know
let this be our prayer when we lose our way
<|endoftext|>

to see the summer sky
is poetry though never in a book it lie
true poems flee
<|endoftext|>

in nine lifetimes
you'll never know as much about your cat as
your cat knows about you
<|endoftext|>

the vision must be followed by the venture
it is not enough to stare up the steps
we must step up the stairs
<|endoftext|>

for all my life's sleeplesness has woven
this shelter in the grove where your hand lives and flies
watching over the night of the sleeping traveler
<|endoftext|>

there is no end
there is no beginning
there is only the passion of life
<|endoftext|>

we may run walk stumble drive or fly
but let us never lose sight of the reason for the journey
or miss a chance to see a rainbow on the way
<|endoftext|>

light-enchanted sunflower thou
who gazest ever true and tender
on the sun's revolving splendour
<|endoftext|>

today she learned that fairies are naughty
she used to wish to be a fairy in the woods
now she know that fairies are evil and she's one of them
<|endoftext|>

unsought and unheard
music falling into feeling
like rain in wind
<|endoftext|>

see no evil
hear no evil
speak no evil
<|endoftext|>

what climbs the stair
nothing that common women ponder on
if you are worth my hope
<|endoftext|>

when light appears upside down
and darkness obove
the master is dancing
<|endoftext|>

enchained in dwindling light
thoughts like grapes in winter
sing summer's refrain
<|endoftext|>

stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away
and yellow leaves of autumn which have no songs flutter and
fall there with a sigh
<|endoftext|>

i think he'll be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by soverneignty of nature
<|endoftext|>

paris' evening
a bird trapped
in its charms
<|endoftext|>

a walking shadow a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more
<|endoftext|>

its mouth opens four times
as out-of-date as a prehistoric monster
yet somehow man-made
<|endoftext|>

green is a solace
a promise of peace a fort
against the cold
<|endoftext|>

nothing is wasted
nothing is in vain
the seas roll over but the rocks remain
<|endoftext|>

trees are poems that earth writes upon the sky
we fell them down and turn them into paper
that we may record our emptiness
<|endoftext|>

i look at you
and see myself
under the surface
<|endoftext|>

may you have the gladness of christmas which is hope
the spirit of christmas which is peace
the heart of christmas which is love
<|endoftext|>

it is late in an afternoon
more grey with snow to fall
than white with fallen snow
<|endoftext|>

my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep the more i give thee
the more i have for both are infinite
<|endoftext|>

on with the dance let joy be unconfined
no sleep till morn when youth and pleasure meet
to chase the glowing hours with flying feet
<|endoftext|>

for all passers by
roses leave love letters
just lying around
<|endoftext|>

dancing the breeze
drinking the light
softly
<|endoftext|>

these are the days when skies resume
the old - old sophistries of june
a blue and gold mistake
<|endoftext|>

yon foaming flood seems motionless as ice
its dizzy turbulence eludes the eye
frozen by distance
<|endoftext|>

our hope for years to come
our shelter from the stormy blast
and our eternal home
<|endoftext|>

between teeth and tongue
red planet bursting luscious
supernova sweet
<|endoftext|>

and as long as my heart will beat
sweet lover we'll always meet
here in my deep purple dreams
<|endoftext|>

in her smile the heat of the sun
in her eyes the light of dawn
in her colors the world irradiated
<|endoftext|>

our street after the rain
core of my heart my country
land of the rainbow gold
<|endoftext|>

dawn leaves
morning light
life
<|endoftext|>

the things you do not have to say make you rich
saying the things you do not have to say weakens your talk
hearing the things you do not need to hear dulls your hearing
<|endoftext|>

let us go then you and i
when the evening is spread out against the sky
like a patient etherized upon a table
<|endoftext|>

wishing and wanting
to see you
i step on thin ice
<|endoftext|>

someone walk a mile in their shoes
then when you do criticize them
you'll be a mile away and you'll have their shoes
<|endoftext|>

still part of the whole
or already forgotten
without a meaning
<|endoftext|>

silent day breaking
saffron yolk of light running
pushing the shadows
<|endoftext|>

shedding energy
small birdquake oscillating
resonating light
<|endoftext|>

hiding in the haze
i can see your white face
hope you na hear my tune
<|endoftext|>

once more as i wait
for you night and icy wind
melt into cold rain
<|endoftext|>

the daffodil is our doorside queen
she pushes upward the sword already
to spot with sunshine the early green
<|endoftext|>

savouring this moment
the world stops spinning around
feeling peace inside
<|endoftext|>

in every bush and brake where hap may find
the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
to hide me and the dark intent i bring
<|endoftext|>

walk around feeling like a leaf
know you could tumble any second
then decide what to do with your time
<|endoftext|>

and i will send the scent to you the scent of these nights
which sliced open pass between us
like a river passes between two banks
<|endoftext|>

and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in gray
and the sun will set for you
<|endoftext|>

the slick black tarmac
snakes on through
the night
<|endoftext|>

in a chapel of sticks
his morning pulpit bright
mastering reddness
<|endoftext|>

whose buzzing was the only sound of life
flew there on restless wing
seeking in vain one blossom where to fix
<|endoftext|>

nothing to say
nothing to think
i had never known such silence
<|endoftext|>

in the australian outback you make do with what you have
when the mike stand went missing at ali curung gospel night
the volunteers stepped up one by one
<|endoftext|>

obove the valley of desire
to the peaks of wisdom
my wings will carry you
<|endoftext|>

take thy plastic spade
it is thy pencil take thy seeds thy plants
they are thy colours
<|endoftext|>

summer grasses
all that remains
of warriors dreams
<|endoftext|>

a little walk with dad
waiting
mom went in there
<|endoftext|>

one never goes so far
as when one doesn't know
where one is going
<|endoftext|>

the light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us only that day dawns to which we are awake
there is more day to dawn
the sun is but a morning star
<|endoftext|>

i dropped down and i called out to heaven send me someone to love
heaven shot back: you get the love that you allow
and everything is different now
<|endoftext|>

and tulips children love to stretch
their fingers down to feel in each
its beauty's sweet nearer
<|endoftext|>

my thoughts are resting
on colourful blossoms yet
free like butterflies
<|endoftext|>

rose of all roses rose of all the world
you too have come where the dim tides are hurled
upon the wharves of sorrow and heard ring the bell that calls us on the sweet far thing
<|endoftext|>

on my way back home
i pass the bridge of peace
uniting heaven and earth
<|endoftext|>

violets in grass
small purple worlds laughing and
smiling at our feet
<|endoftext|>

when you arise in the morning
think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive
to breathe to think to enjoy to love
<|endoftext|>

doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little
to cure diseases of which they know less
in human beings of whom they know nothing
<|endoftext|>

if we are not happy and joyous at this season
for what other season shall we wait
and for what other time shall we look
<|endoftext|>

you must live in the present
launch yourself on every wave
find your eternity in each moment
<|endoftext|>

in magic days and nights
i fly obove my alps
smileing
<|endoftext|>

and heaven in a wild flower
hold infinity in the palm of your hand
and eternity in an hour
<|endoftext|>

today i fly
im full of love
for myself
<|endoftext|>

how i do love thee
oh virtuous untamed lawn
sweet and unfettered
<|endoftext|>

on desolation
i was the alonest man
in the world
<|endoftext|>

light like a prayer
like a heartbeat through the trees
blessing everything
<|endoftext|>

this world
bristles with thorns
yet there are lotuses
<|endoftext|>

darkness and light
no longer enemies
play together
<|endoftext|>

now every sound at length is hush'd away
these few are sacred moments one more day
drops in the shadowy gulf of bygone things
<|endoftext|>

the tree
is calling
my dream
<|endoftext|>

a shot that i never uploaded reworked with a texture layer
the first act of awe when man was struck with the beauty
or wonder of nature was the first spiritual experience
<|endoftext|>

i am rain falling from the skies
and frozen i fall as snow
i flow toward the sea
<|endoftext|>

i'm falling into you
this dream could come true
and it feels so good falling into you
<|endoftext|>

twin medusae
hydrozoan symmetry
swaying in tandem
<|endoftext|>

one loon wings up
beyond the leaf-lined bridge
my soul in tow
<|endoftext|>

the quickest way to receive love is to give
the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly
and the best way to keep love is to give it wings
<|endoftext|>

o love o fire once he drew
with one long kiss my whole soul through
my lips as sunlight drinketh dew
<|endoftext|>

flawless twilight skies
waning moon midsummer's glow
shines down on us all
<|endoftext|>

man cannot discover new oceans
unless he had the courage
to lose sight of the shore
<|endoftext|>

vast pallid clouds blue spaces undefiled
room give me room give loneliness and air
free things and plenteous in your regions fair
<|endoftext|>

do you remember when we met
that's the day i knew you were my pet
i want to tell you how much i love you
<|endoftext|>

perhaps this silent
wanderer fashions flowers
dreamy butterfly
<|endoftext|>

and lilies white prepared to touch
the whitest thought nor soil it much
of dreamer turned to lover
<|endoftext|>

still downward with capacious whirl they glide
and now i see them on a green hill's side
in breezy rest among the nodding stalks
<|endoftext|>

ride boldly ride
the shade replied
if you seek for eldorado
<|endoftext|>

flowers plash open
like milk drop coronets
in split second summer
<|endoftext|>

i fear no man no woman
flower does not fear
bird insect nor adder
<|endoftext|>

lazy the time is spreading its moments
falling asleep among poppy flowers
at its ear a cricket is chirping
<|endoftext|>

the camera is an instrument
that teaches people how to see
without a camera
<|endoftext|>

through good times and bad times
i'll be by your side forevermore
that is what friends are for
<|endoftext|>

deep in the dark woods
murk in my mind vanished by
this light from above
<|endoftext|>

it was air
and playing lovely and watery
and fire green as grass
<|endoftext|>

all of the buses
safely hidden till the fall
yellow chariots
<|endoftext|>

climb the mountains and get their good tidings nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees
the winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy
while cares will drop off like autumn leaves
<|endoftext|>

it is right precious to behold
the first long surf of climbing light
flood all the thirsty east with gold
<|endoftext|>

the art of being two but one
the art of being one but two
the art of being happy together
<|endoftext|>

let the rain kiss you
let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops
let the rain sing you a lullaby
<|endoftext|>

birds of the foliage will leap in the air
when your laugh like an extravagant
light breaks through the tree of life
<|endoftext|>

when time is over
will anybody recall
that there once was more
<|endoftext|>

i am constantly amazed
at the startling lack of insignificance
in the world perceivable
<|endoftext|>

i saw old autumn in the misty morn
stand shadowless like silence listening
to silence
<|endoftext|>

it has come to pass
all that is mortal is lost
sometime anywhere
<|endoftext|>

to find the beauty
even if it's dark and grey
that lightens my day
<|endoftext|>

time sometimes flies like a bird
sometimes crawls like a snail
but a man is happiest when he does not even notice whether it passes swiftly or slowly
<|endoftext|>

autumn is leaving
tugging each others' branches
two pine trees
<|endoftext|>

hanging like dreamers
words like sleeping bees stir
slowly waking the hive
<|endoftext|>

and through the glass window shines the sun
how should i love
and i so young
<|endoftext|>

for the secret of the sea
and the heart of the great ocean
sends a thrilling pulse through me
<|endoftext|>

borderline
between me
and my self
<|endoftext|>

and they were canopied by the blue sky
so cloudless clear and purely beautiful
that god alone was to be seen in heaven
<|endoftext|>

in my heart's garden
you are there as ever brightly
glowing ambient
<|endoftext|>

as the images unwind
like the circles that you'll find
in the windmills of your mind
<|endoftext|>

there must be some good
hidden amidst all the bad
know i will find it
<|endoftext|>

in a chapel of air
wings like tracery windows
consecrating light
<|endoftext|>

why art thou silent is thy love a plant
of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
of absence withers what was once so fair
<|endoftext|>

no border to cross to shambala
follow your heart
it flys to the kingdom like a feather
<|endoftext|>

everything has its wonders even darkness and silence
'cause the grave soul keeps its own secrets
and takes its own punishment in silence
<|endoftext|>

coming going the waterbirds
don't leave a trace
don't follow a path
<|endoftext|>

we all have wings
but they have not been of any avail to us and
if we could tear them off we would do so
<|endoftext|>

autumn
my tears drop
from rose leaves
<|endoftext|>

found within: soft light
moon shadow winter's sigh spring's
whisper time's dream
<|endoftext|>

we hope that when the insects take over the world
they will remember with gratitude
how we took them along on our picnics
<|endoftext|>

the winds give me
enough fallen leaves
to make a fire
<|endoftext|>

spirit and nature
melt in one morning light
while i walk to the toilette
<|endoftext|>

after the first powerful plain manifesto
the black statement of pistons without more fuss
but gliding like a queen she leaves the station
<|endoftext|>

without just one nest
a bird can call the world home
life is your career
<|endoftext|>

through the portals of silence
the healing sun of wisdom
and peace will shine upon you
<|endoftext|>

your words become my words
your words are my words
my words will be your words
<|endoftext|>

the dawn is replete with fruit day and night reconciled flow like a calm river
day and night in a long caress like a man and woman in love
like a single endless river under the vaults of centuries where the seasons and people flow toward the living center of origin beyond end and beginning
<|endoftext|>

it is the common wonder of all men
how among so many millions of faces
there should be none alike
<|endoftext|>

the maples flare among the spruces
the bursting foxgrape spills its juices
the woods are waving farewell summer
<|endoftext|>

she has the spirit of the sun
the moods of the moon
the will of the wind
<|endoftext|>

oh the sea the sun
in november the sea is
a lake of red fire
<|endoftext|>

passing the clouds by
sailing through the sky
the buildings fly
<|endoftext|>

i know of the leafy paths that the witches take
who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool
and their secret smile out of the depths of the lake
<|endoftext|>

life is pleasant
death is peaceful
it's the transition that's troublesome
<|endoftext|>

summer suspended
warm buzzing tempest laid flat
reliquery sun
<|endoftext|>

the line of nature
feeds the eye and mind with awe
a natural flow
<|endoftext|>

sometimes people need to take their own advice
don't be a hypocrite
practice what you preach
<|endoftext|>

how beautifully leaves grow old
how full of light
and color are their last days
<|endoftext|>

my mother told me
that a yellow sunset means
hard wind is coming
<|endoftext|>

some leaves hang late and some fall
before the first frost so goes
the tale of winter branches and old bones
<|endoftext|>

long shadows at noon
means winter and sun cold day
of peaceful walking
<|endoftext|>

follow where the sun treads
if you see footprints of light
go that way
<|endoftext|>

clouds hang on bare trees
but the snow on the mountains
is a white blessing
<|endoftext|>

a magnetic silence
made a ripple
in a muscle of presence
<|endoftext|>

nature holds the key
to our aesthetic intellectual cognitive
and even spiritual satisfaction
<|endoftext|>

in the cold season
a jewel jam is an aid
to my freezing heart
<|endoftext|>

a bright full moon rose
seeming near enough to touch
perigee present
<|endoftext|>

can you see the ray
if you can see it you will
soon find your true love
<|endoftext|>

sourwood racemes
flowers just a memory
autumnal pendants
<|endoftext|>

aperture golden
bundle of rays traversing
instrument of light
<|endoftext|>

as thick as morning's tears
and dreamy scents of fragrance pass
that breathe of other years
<|endoftext|>

love is not something that you can put chains on and throw into a lake
that's called houdini
love is liking someone a lot
<|endoftext|>

wind-blown child of earth
fathered by the elements
mothered by the light
<|endoftext|>

moon is a whole note
cloudy stanzas span blue sky
staccato geese soar
<|endoftext|>

and at the end of a long day
with all the pressure and troubles of living
there comes a moment of peace
<|endoftext|>

a storm in the fall or winter is the time to visit it
a light-house or a fisherman's hut the true hotel
a man may stand there and put all america behind him
<|endoftext|>

the winter is made and you have to bear it
the winter web the winter woven wind and wind
for all the thoughts of summer that go with it
<|endoftext|>

it is courage courage courage
that raises the blood of life to crimson splendor
live bravely and present a brave front to adversity
<|endoftext|>

on lifes vast ocean diversely we sail
reason the card
but passion is the gale
<|endoftext|>

doves in the morning
love flowering on a branch
beautiful bouquet
<|endoftext|>

deciduous she
birds in winter are her blooms
flowers for althea
<|endoftext|>

beauty is mysterious as well as terrible
god and devil are fighting there
and the battlefield is the heart of man
<|endoftext|>

a turn done in air
the sprightly red dancer bounds
a dance without plot
<|endoftext|>

spinning wheel of hearts
love at the ends of petals
unfolding brightly
<|endoftext|>

horizon slanting
the grey sea of winter is
paved in iced glass tiles
<|endoftext|>

though nothing can bring back the hour
of splendour in the grass
of glory in the flower
<|endoftext|>

old sakura your long winter song is so sorrowful
you are waiting for last springs  you are waiting for last blossoms
i am feeling all traces of last centure times on your horny warm skin
<|endoftext|>

old sakuras noiseless talks about last and future blossoms
fill me with sorrowful mood
i am listening to the old trees whisper
<|endoftext|>

winters flame burning
brightly through darkening days
brave little pilot
<|endoftext|>

it goes to show you don't ever know
watch each card you play
and play it slow
<|endoftext|>

embraced by branches
full moon stands on winter morning
how it holds the sky
<|endoftext|>

my respiration and inspiration
the beating of my heart
the passing of blood and air
<|endoftext|>

i dreamed of an out-thrust arm of land
where gulls blew over a wave
that fell along miles of sand
<|endoftext|>

ripening of leaves
the vermillion crescendo
red coals in winter
<|endoftext|>

red skies at night
two crows in flight
moon shining bright
<|endoftext|>

winter lies too long in country towns
hangs on until it is stale and shabby
old and sullen
<|endoftext|>

new leaves brand new green
yellow spring flower among
yesterday's brown spikes
<|endoftext|>

from the tops of trees
red cardinals will alight
in the dormant grass
<|endoftext|>

out of cold thin air
brilliant carmine leaves will form
on dormant branches
<|endoftext|>

from a rooftop in boston i heard a lot of birds squawking nearby and was lucky enough to use my limited zoom to catch the culprit perched on a pergola in the distance
i am but mad north-north-west
when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw
<|endoftext|>

the roots of the grass strain
tighten the earth is rigid waits he is waiting
and suddenly and all at once the rain
<|endoftext|>

early spring sunlight
on a double espresso
i'm working from home
<|endoftext|>

mere colour unspoiled by meaning
and unallied with definite form
can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways
<|endoftext|>

what is the good of your stars and trees
your sunrise and the wind
if they do not enter into our daily lives
<|endoftext|>

there is a serene and settled majesty to woodland scenery
that enters into the soul and delights and elevates it
and fills it with noble inclinations
<|endoftext|>

any man that walks the mead
in bud or blade or bloom may find
a meaning suited to his mind
<|endoftext|>

faith is the pierless bridge
supporting what we see
unto the scene that we do not
<|endoftext|>

the temple bell stops
but i still hear the sound
coming out of the flowers
<|endoftext|>

which one is tallest
the nearest or the farthest
but both in my mind
<|endoftext|>

sight is a distraction
sight is a deception
perception is a hallucination
<|endoftext|>

riverbed secrets
yielding fragmental colours
pop and beer bottles
<|endoftext|>

clouds come floating into my life
no longer to carry rain or usher storm
but to add colour to my sunset sky
<|endoftext|>

i usually wear black but i love bold colors
i think i'm normal even colors are important to me
if i couldn't see the colors now that would be a problem
<|endoftext|>

sun set within its
petals transforming
golden light of life
<|endoftext|>

like a summer breeze
blue sky landing in my heart
a cloud with feathers
<|endoftext|>

slung between branches
radiating summer sun
the winter hammock
<|endoftext|>

it is the very error of the moon
she comes more nearer earth than she was wont
and makes men mad
<|endoftext|>

gannet soaring high
defining freedom
two wings and open sky
<|endoftext|>

we cannot die we cannot hurt ourselves any more than illusions on the screen can be hurt
but we can believe were hurt in whatever agonizing detail we want
we can believe were victims killed and killing shuddered around by good luck and bad luck
<|endoftext|>

don't walk in front of me i may not follow
don't walk behind me i may not lead
just walk beside me and be my friend
<|endoftext|>

the morning sunrise
so beautiful to behold
glowing breath of light
<|endoftext|>

sunlight plows
then seeds its blue dust
upon the land
<|endoftext|>

if we had a keen vision of all that is ordinary in human life
it would be like hearing the grass grow or the squirrel's heart beat
and we should die of that roar which is the other side of silence
<|endoftext|>

i do not know how to kiss
or i would kiss you
where do the noses go
<|endoftext|>

a green childhood
emerges through twisted age
shedding light
<|endoftext|>

a spring
a pool among the rock
if there were the sound of water only
<|endoftext|>

i wander
i get lost
and wander
<|endoftext|>

waking up
the spring rain hasn't cleared
the day hasn't ended
<|endoftext|>

reality is but a picture
gaze is but a focus
and the eye is a camera
<|endoftext|>

looking at the world
looking back at me
documenting the conversation through a lens
<|endoftext|>

corner of my eye
perception is blurry line
between truth and lie
<|endoftext|>

blurry focus very dreamy
trapped in surreality
is this dream or reality
<|endoftext|>

my gaze
and my camera
capture photos that always amaze
<|endoftext|>

sunset crowns the hill
kissing her brow so gently
radiant verdure
<|endoftext|>

happy to be here
sparrow says good morning day
in the golden light
<|endoftext|>

the image dates itself
but the eye time-travels
between then and when
<|endoftext|>

water is the mother of the vine
the nurse and fountain of fecundity
the adorner and refresher of the world
<|endoftext|>

beautiful eyes that gleam with mystic light
as candles lighted at full noon the sun
dims not your flame phantastical and bright
<|endoftext|>

i know what darkness is
it accumulates thickens
then suddenly bursts and drowns everything
<|endoftext|>

nature is full of genius
full of the divinity
so that not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand
<|endoftext|>

sun spires of fire
encased in royalty blooms
croaks the frog 'sundown
<|endoftext|>

beyond the white fence
a global ever changing wave
became only property
<|endoftext|>

when we describe what the other person is really like
i suppose we often picture what we want
we look through the prism of our need
<|endoftext|>

tears fall like silence
haiku hanging from a branch
words are descending
<|endoftext|>

for all that you stand so firmly rooted
so still you quiver
there is movement in every leaf
<|endoftext|>

nature teaches more than she preaches
there are no sermons in stones
it is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral
<|endoftext|>

rain and wind brought leaves
at the door the gentlest breath
was a rose for me
<|endoftext|>

strings silent as air
no aeolian harp is this
just a blue guitar
<|endoftext|>

oh as i was young and easy in the mercy of his means
time held me green and dying
though i sang in my chains like the sea
<|endoftext|>

the wings of the moths catch the sunlight
and burn
so brightly
<|endoftext|>

my quizzical too
bluest bluet brusquely bluffs
bully on a branch
<|endoftext|>

light melts
as it rolls over
its own heat-waves
<|endoftext|>

rest your weary feet
comfy place to sit and eat
the squirrel settle
<|endoftext|>

sea spray's frothy lace
waves sweeping sandy edges
- a moment of joy
<|endoftext|>

i'm so sweet on him
bright red flash on dormant grass
i call him my crush
<|endoftext|>

there is a land of the living
and a land of the dead
and the bridge is love
<|endoftext|>

alchemy of light
turning moments into gold
everywhere i look
<|endoftext|>

how you eye me so
inclined on a branch steeply
homage picasso
<|endoftext|>

ultimately literature is nothing but carpentry
with both you are working with reality
a material just as hard as wood
<|endoftext|>

accepting the absence of your skin
is fuel that keeps you somehow alive
in thirtyfive kind of colourful dreams
<|endoftext|>

cupid's arrow darts
love often feels like a blur
red heart with feathers
<|endoftext|>

round and red and warm
sunshine for a cold monday
bright scarlet engine
<|endoftext|>

perching on one foot
i'm a little icicle
on a winter branch
<|endoftext|>

meridian gold
the morning dove in transit
celestial form
<|endoftext|>

count the waves
count the sand
count your blessings
<|endoftext|>

the clouds that gather round the setting sun
do take a sober colouring from an eye
that hath kept watch over mans mortality
<|endoftext|>

thought is the blossom
language the bud
action the fruit
<|endoftext|>

dawn and dusk cycle
another tree has fallen
now rests silently
<|endoftext|>

is not words
it is
the heart of things
<|endoftext|>

my soul is an enchanted boat
which like a sleeping swan doth float
upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing
<|endoftext|>

the fence around a cemetery is foolish
for those inside can't get out
and those outside don't want to get in
<|endoftext|>

in any city
there are always places
where sky can meet water
<|endoftext|>

the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in gray
and the sun will set for you
<|endoftext|>

a building's dark heart
bleeds grime decay from it's seams
the city's mirror
<|endoftext|>

dragons come and go
it's part of the game
playing ball just the same
<|endoftext|>

only as high as i reach can i grow
only as far as i seek can i go
only as much as i dream can i be
<|endoftext|>

he mourns that day so soon has glided by
even like the passage of an angels tear
that falls through the clear ether silently
<|endoftext|>

at certain times
just before the light fades
comes those magic golden moments
<|endoftext|>

sentinel staring
as i hold my breath
winter sun burning
<|endoftext|>

yellow hammering
audible beacon tapping
visible morse code
<|endoftext|>

we are like butterflies
who flutter for a day
and think it is forever
<|endoftext|>

spring buds glow
yet she fades
soft tears in embrace
<|endoftext|>

a stream of my thoughts
washing over my short life
the sound renews me
<|endoftext|>

business casual
or me  wayyy in between here
just left of your right
<|endoftext|>

lone tree in field
in a melody of hope
dreams of a long summer
<|endoftext|>

sun arise bring in the morning
sun arise bring in the dawning
spreading all the light all around
<|endoftext|>

green glory
flowers glory
breezes glory
<|endoftext|>

my empty strumming
overtaken by the storm
fading memories
<|endoftext|>

you can't fence him in
rebel in a shark skin suit
he's blue greased lightning
<|endoftext|>

water kissed
flower of mine
bliss filled end of summer
<|endoftext|>

shadows of my life
walking closer or away
i'm still no closer
<|endoftext|>

her contentedness
plainly shown upon her face
tame or still wild
<|endoftext|>

the longest journey
is the journey inwards
of him who has chosen his destiny
<|endoftext|>

it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility
they must have action
and they will make it if they cannot find it
<|endoftext|>

resting here to sing
tiny graces of the wind
trills pierce leaden air
<|endoftext|>

i'd be a butterfly
living a rover
dying when fair things are fading away
<|endoftext|>

no spring
nor summer beauty hath such grace
as i have seen in one autumnal face
<|endoftext|>

when one door closes another door opens
but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door
that we do not see the ones which open for us
<|endoftext|>

climb the mountains and get their good tidings nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees
the winds will blow their own freshness into you
while cares will drop off like autumn leaves
<|endoftext|>

this bud of love
by summer's ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
<|endoftext|>

buttons and bellows
a box full of singing reeds
the concertina
<|endoftext|>

when i speak
my lips feel cold
the autumn wind
<|endoftext|>

how like a queen comes forth the lonely moon
from the slow opening curtains of the clouds
walking in beauty to her midnight throne
<|endoftext|>

windy day
color washed air
touched with winter coming
<|endoftext|>

in the summer heat
like hot coals under your feet
where sun and sand meet
<|endoftext|>

we all live in a house on fire
no fire department to call
no way out just the upstairs window to look out of while the fire burns the house down with us trapped locked in it
<|endoftext|>

life is like an onion
you peel it off one layer at a time
and sometimes you weep
<|endoftext|>

the silver swan who
living had no note
when death approached unlocked her silent throat
<|endoftext|>

in sowing questions
for which there are no answers
she's finding her peace
<|endoftext|>

here come the hum the golden bees
underneath full blossomed trees
at once with glowing fruit and flowers crowned
<|endoftext|>

a christmas candle is a lovely thing
it makes no noise at all
but softly gives itself away
<|endoftext|>

i love tranquil solitude
and such society
as is quiet wise and good
<|endoftext|>

has come to town
with a yellow petticoat
and a pretty green gown
<|endoftext|>

be yourself
be unique
be a twig boat racer
<|endoftext|>

got just a dusting
snow heavier south of here
it's still very cold
<|endoftext|>

coffee makes us severe
and grave
and philosophical
<|endoftext|>

sea life
green filter
energy maker
<|endoftext|>

oh my ways are strange ways and new ways and old ways
and deep ways and steep ways and high ways and low i'm at home and at ease on a track that i know not
and restless and lost on a road that i know
<|endoftext|>

city cold glass metal
a noise reflection
beauty trapped 'n skinned
<|endoftext|>

stranger to england
fragile fugitive fingers
reaching for the sun
<|endoftext|>

colourful music
temporal variations
my reflected theme
<|endoftext|>

perhaps the truth
depends upon a walk
around the lake
<|endoftext|>

penitent petal
not quite finished unfurling
awaits sun's blessing
<|endoftext|>

his rays are all gold and his beauties are best
as painting the skies he sinks down in the west
and foretells a bright rising again
<|endoftext|>

there is something haunting in the light of the moon
it has all the dispassionateness of a disembodied soul
and something of its inconceivable mystery
<|endoftext|>

beauty of whatever kind
in its supreme development
invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears
<|endoftext|>

the beautiful spring came
and when nature resumes her loveliness
the human soul is apt to revive also
<|endoftext|>

a light exists in spring
not present on the year
at any other period
<|endoftext|>

blue gold sky painted
by my master
with his gentle hands
<|endoftext|>

through the closed blinds the golden sun
poured in a dusty beam
like the celestial ladder seen
<|endoftext|>

our lives are like islands in the sea
or like trees in the forest
which co-mingle their roots in the darkness underground
<|endoftext|>

young as she is the stuff
of her life is a great cargo and some of it heavy
i wish her a lucky passage
<|endoftext|>

spirit
who put the spirit in matter
love
<|endoftext|>

eclipsing to shine
amid the fretted net
light interlacing
<|endoftext|>

it will never rain roses
when we want to have more roses
we must plant more roses
<|endoftext|>

we enjoy warmth because we have been cold
we appreciate light because we have been in darkness
by the same token we can experience joy because we have known sadness
<|endoftext|>

no pole no paddle
it doesn't really matter
just go with the flow
<|endoftext|>

the face of heaven and show
where sweet peace doth abide
where truth and beauty grow
<|endoftext|>

the trees are god's great alphabet
with them he writes in shining green
across the world his thoughts serene
<|endoftext|>

as if by magic
sun and rain and rain again
and a pearl of light
<|endoftext|>

life is a stream
on which we strew
petal by petal the flower of our heart
<|endoftext|>

in the way that we
without even noticing
complete each other
<|endoftext|>

the world is full of little wonders
the art of life is to develop
the eye to discover them
<|endoftext|>

today
banish the word 'gray
from your world
<|endoftext|>

a shameless blue heart
glows in the jade summer woods
draped with muslin wings
<|endoftext|>

after the flower
and before the fruit red gems
on a green background
<|endoftext|>

light is the shadowland
we inhabit when darkness
fails to reveal all that we really see
<|endoftext|>

i sit sometimes
in my box
and dream of flying
<|endoftext|>

a moment rustle
in the grasses of the fields
spring is leaving us
<|endoftext|>

oh how small my sweet
is your painted parasol
in this intense heat
<|endoftext|>

sweet lipstick kisses
left by the sun on beaches
at the end of day
<|endoftext|>

deep in the darkness
fly all things that we most fear
lose them in the light
<|endoftext|>

dissolving in sea
sweet golden lozenge
soothing suffusion
<|endoftext|>

only in this one
waving clump of grasses
cool winds has stayed
<|endoftext|>

an asteroid stays
in my right eye dazzling me
as the july sun
<|endoftext|>

and i feel just like i'm living someone else's life
it's like i just stepped outside
when everything was going right
<|endoftext|>

o lady
we recieve but what we give
and in our life alone does nature live
<|endoftext|>

keep your faith in all beautiful things
in the sun when it is hidden
in the spring when it is gone
<|endoftext|>

searching for blue sky
navigating by the stars
sometimes it finds you
<|endoftext|>

flowers beautiful flowers
children humanity lovely love life
embrace all ~ please
<|endoftext|>

the only reason for time
is so that everything
doesn't happen at once
<|endoftext|>

and saw that everything is one
and moveless in the eternal light
never completed not begun
<|endoftext|>

better to light a candle
than to curse
the darkness
<|endoftext|>

stillness
the cicada's cry
drills into the rocks
<|endoftext|>

said i oh give me simplicity
purity
truthful rurallity
<|endoftext|>

oh for the wonder that bubbles into my soul
i would be a good fountain a good well-head
would blur no whisper spoil no expression
<|endoftext|>

concrete atlantus
tried to sail the seven seas
but sank just offshore
<|endoftext|>

in eveningwinds
all roses are going
to move slowly
<|endoftext|>

tyger tyger
burning bright
in the forests of the night
<|endoftext|>

sweet day so cool so calm so bright
the bridall of the earth and skie
the dew shall weep thy fall tonight
<|endoftext|>

you can't be suspicious of a tree
or accuse a bird or a squirrel of subversion
or challenge the ideology of a violet
<|endoftext|>

a blue note resting
in a line of green music
sweet and clear and high
<|endoftext|>

though inland far we be
our souls have sight of that immortal sea
which brought us hither
<|endoftext|>

the road winding above among the mountains
which are mountains of rock without water
if there were water we should stop and drink
<|endoftext|>

leaves falling spinning
slowly tumbling to the ground
caught by blowing wind
<|endoftext|>

where the blue of the night
meets the gold of the day
all the magic begins
<|endoftext|>

a soft light
a scent in the air
the quiet murmur of the city
<|endoftext|>

the burning last days
of the sun
stretch into cool waters
<|endoftext|>

every color
comes from the light-box
of the sky
<|endoftext|>

you spin me right round baby
right round like a record baby
right round round round
<|endoftext|>

at dusk
the sea walked with me
into the gray
<|endoftext|>

i'll be as patient as a gentle stream
and make a pastime of each weary step
till the last step have brought me to my love
<|endoftext|>

some morning's
we live on top of the sky
and fish for the sun
<|endoftext|>

as we looked back
the stern wheeler
faded into yesterday
<|endoftext|>

i have seen the world
spread below me like a quilt
confident of air
<|endoftext|>

through a glass darkly
we see a poor reflection
of the other side
<|endoftext|>

signs in the evening sky
who reads
only the wind in the streets forgotten
<|endoftext|>

silence afforded
only from throbbing numbness
no longer feeling
<|endoftext|>

so many seeds red
and juicy dripping staining
a rainy autumn
<|endoftext|>

take me
just let me
whatever results youre getting be they rich or poor good or bad positive or negative always remember that your outer world is simply a reflection of your inner world  if things arent going well in your outer life its because things arent going well in your inner life  its that simple
<|endoftext|>

if life is not
an occasional fast ride
then its not a life
<|endoftext|>

contrast loving child
born of daylight and of night
at their edges stirs
<|endoftext|>

blowing sea spray into the air
and
walking on water will take me there
<|endoftext|>

lady in waiting
unfettered oracle prophetic
rapunzel in pink
<|endoftext|>

fog has descended
muting the pines' green needles
at november's end
<|endoftext|>

wasting not a thing
life puts pears in strawberries
mysteries unfold
<|endoftext|>

bring from above
echoes of mercy
whispers of love
<|endoftext|>

like a bird on a wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free
<|endoftext|>

simple winterland
a world of one colour
voices of the wind
<|endoftext|>

remember to remember me
standing still in your past
floating fast like a hummingbird
<|endoftext|>

a tree dreams and floats
birds and fish fly together
my toes icy water
<|endoftext|>

no horizon: light
as a line down to the side
of the winter sea
<|endoftext|>

and who do you think you are
running 'round leaving scars
collecting your jar of hearts  amp tearing love apart
<|endoftext|>

in winter skies
winds blow with icy fingers
and the quiet sign creaks
<|endoftext|>

desolate yet all undaunted
on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror haunted
<|endoftext|>

out of the dark we came
into the dark we go
like a storm-driven bird at night we fly out of the nowhere
<|endoftext|>

life is made up of moments
small pieces of glittering mica
in a long stretch of gray cement
<|endoftext|>

let us go and see if the rose
which this morning had blown
her purple dress to the sun
<|endoftext|>

on the path that leads to nowhere
i have sometimes found my soul
from the path that leads to nowhere
<|endoftext|>

one dream one soul one prize one goal
one golden glance of what should be
one shaft of light that shows the way
<|endoftext|>

all my life i believed i knew something
but then one strange day came when i realized that i knew nothing yes i knew nothing
and so words became void of meaning i have arrived too late at ultimate uncertainty
<|endoftext|>

her angels face
as the great eye of heaven shyned bright
and made a sunshine in the shady place
<|endoftext|>

all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost
the old that is strong does not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renenwed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king
<|endoftext|>

guess where dear the sea
is green even in winter
mirrored by my eyes
<|endoftext|>

we came into the world like brother and brother
and now lets go hand in hand
not one before another
<|endoftext|>

sunset hour magic
and vibrant a purple gem
the barbed wire
<|endoftext|>

a rainy night in georgia a rainy night in georgia
it seems like it's rainin' all over the world
i feel like it's rainin' all over the world
<|endoftext|>

a hush is over everything
silent as women wait for love
the world is waiting for the spring
<|endoftext|>

that's hidden in the deep
where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
the modern world is broken
<|endoftext|>

on this rainy day
i used a smile for an umbrella
and passed it on to everyone i met
<|endoftext|>

light filled days
a walk with you
a homecoming
<|endoftext|>

i believe in the compelling power of love
i do not understand it
i believe it to be the most fragrant blossom of all this thorny existence
<|endoftext|>

when cherry blossoms
scatter
no regrets
<|endoftext|>

what a pity flowers can utter no sound
a singing rose a whispering violet a murmuring honeysuckle
oh what a rare and exquisite miracle would these be
<|endoftext|>

fowls by winter forced
forsake the floods
and wing their hasty flight to happier lands
<|endoftext|>

the size of a dime
blending in is his strong suit
animated rock
<|endoftext|>

while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony
and the deep power of joy
we see into the life of things
<|endoftext|>

night hair of some sea woman
curls on the sand when the sea leaves
the salt tide without a good-by
<|endoftext|>

step through a sunset
into this thorny dream night
of a waltz
<|endoftext|>

oh the summer night
has a smile of light
and she sits on a sapphire throne
<|endoftext|>

and if i could be inside her light
i would steal enough to make my way into the night
and if i could be inside her light i might just find i'd be alright
<|endoftext|>

come on babe
why don't we paint the town
and all that jazz
<|endoftext|>

an object light skin
wearing the august sun as
a silver garland
<|endoftext|>

dancing on water
in shimmering summer shades
we swim through the sky
<|endoftext|>

is not a kiss
the very autograph
of love
<|endoftext|>

shoot for the moon
even if you miss
you'll land among the stars
<|endoftext|>

within you i lose myself
without you i find myself
wanting to be lost again
<|endoftext|>

waiting is painful
forgetting is painful
but not knowing which to do is the worse kind of suffering
<|endoftext|>

a pessimist only sees the dark side of the clouds and mopes
a philosopher sees both sides and shrugs
an optimist doesn't see the clouds at all he's walking on them
<|endoftext|>

yellow slickers up on swings
like puppets on strings
hanging in the sky
<|endoftext|>

i've always liked the view from my mother-in-law's house at night
oil rigs off long beach
like floating lanterns out in the smog-dark pacific
<|endoftext|>

morning is when the wick is lit
a flame ignited the day delighted with heat and light
we start the fight for something more than before
<|endoftext|>

maple lights in wood
like stars of natures heaven
nourishing the earth
<|endoftext|>

autumn sunrays shine
on forest trees soon to sleep
coloured shadows weep
<|endoftext|>

night sunset in wales
ancestors of this landscape
gazed upon this scene
<|endoftext|>

autumn sunshine glows
on nature's sparkling jewels
colours of heaven
<|endoftext|>

walk lime avenue
where golden autumn stars shine
and fall on the earth
<|endoftext|>

the snow white angels
out of the shadows they glide
perfect harmony
<|endoftext|>

all men should strive
to learn before they die
what they are running from and to and why
<|endoftext|>

white wings of angel
floating in the autumn sky
seagull softly fly
<|endoftext|>

tall grass dusts the skyline
water-colour shades settle over the earth
punctuating my existence once more
<|endoftext|>

every day the sun
and after sunset night and her stars
ever the winds blow ever the grass grows
<|endoftext|>

rust and red magic
lit by nature's autumn sun
tall trees protecting
<|endoftext|>

dreams are the seeds of change
nothing ever grows without a seed
and nothing ever changes without a dream
<|endoftext|>

a wild camomile
visible to your mind of the poor
the plumed thistle ogre
<|endoftext|>

sinking of the sun
sunlight sparkles on the lake
before black night comes
<|endoftext|>

sunset on the hill
lights the end of autumn day
with glowing sunrays
<|endoftext|>

slash open the sleeve
as if you were cutting into a paper lantern
and enter a moon spilled like a melon
<|endoftext|>

the swan glides slowly
in silence and serenity
on the mirrored lake
<|endoftext|>

mutual respect
as i look you in the eye
two different worlds connect
<|endoftext|>

before the red gate
only one choice to be made
enter or escape
<|endoftext|>

clouds come floating into my life
no longer to carry rain or usher storm
but to add color to my sunset sky
<|endoftext|>

and the leaf is an ache
and love an ache in the back
the stone a creature
<|endoftext|>

remember
this december
that love weighs more than gold
<|endoftext|>

how i wish you were
near me loquat flowers smell
of winter for miles
<|endoftext|>

power is what one doesn't have to exercise
let us hope that the destruction of this
planet is in our power
<|endoftext|>

life is like riding a bicycle
- in order to keep your balance
you must keep moving
<|endoftext|>

the power lines stretched
across the kingdom of frost
north of all music
<|endoftext|>

he who binds to himself a joy
but he who kisses the joy as it flies
lives in eternity's sunrise
<|endoftext|>

winter sea stormy
high tides in january
and a young boy
<|endoftext|>

through the tree shadows
swimming on the sparkling lake
in last light of day
<|endoftext|>

gold coloured sunset
amber jewelled watered lake
the magic hour
<|endoftext|>

no man is an island
entire of itself
every man is a piece of the continent
<|endoftext|>

swans rest together
in the evening star sunset
until darkness falls
<|endoftext|>

shadows and sunset
spirits of coal ships sail here
in new cardiff bay
<|endoftext|>

gold tree grows by lake
branches arch towards the sun
shelter for the swans
<|endoftext|>

always remember
you will never be alone
when you have a friend
<|endoftext|>

sometimes we are brave
but we also have fear
we always need hope
<|endoftext|>

darkness has a light
when we look through the shadows
for love we may seek
<|endoftext|>

white barn owl i held
heart shaped face and beautiful
looked at me with peace
<|endoftext|>

eyes of golden light
face with dreamlike majesty
hidden voice within
<|endoftext|>

look of pride in eyes
beautiful kestrel has the
colours of rainbow
<|endoftext|>

winter came down to our home one night
quietly pirouetting in on silvery-toed slippers of snow
and we we were children once again
<|endoftext|>

in the morning snow
beauty stands  so motionless
black as ebony
<|endoftext|>

no bunch of flowers
only this magnolia bud
i do not forget
<|endoftext|>

a skein of seven
silent sandhills overhead
an ancient journey
<|endoftext|>

dragonfly so blue
just rests on a rock in pond
it will never fly
<|endoftext|>

by the jetty waits
a silver boat for sailing
on water so blue
<|endoftext|>

winter frozen lakes
supporting a frozen snake
motionless swimming
<|endoftext|>

earth frozen with ice
snow covered in winters cold
ponies on the hill
<|endoftext|>

as i stand by your flame
i get burned once again
feelin' low down i'm blue
<|endoftext|>

can you see me here
i am hiding in the sea
keep this memory
<|endoftext|>

golden crocuses
reaching out towards the sun
harbingers of spring
<|endoftext|>

i walked the long path
to the ancient cathedral
and my soul found peace
<|endoftext|>

light shone from the hill
in this place of such beauty
shades of blues and greens
<|endoftext|>

surfers sea surfing
at one with the tumbling foam
silvered waves of sea
<|endoftext|>

village pond of old
reflection of ancient farm
mirrored on the sky
<|endoftext|>

spreading tentacles
mimic the colour of dreams
rocked in tidal sway
<|endoftext|>

how green is my land
spring now bursting with fresh life
trees with new leaves hang
<|endoftext|>

clouds at sunset time
hide the dying gold sun rays
shine as magic lights
<|endoftext|>

tardis rise from sea
copper roof now shining gold
space like sentinel
<|endoftext|>

born in raging wind
lashed with icy rain on hill
beautiful today
<|endoftext|>

heaven meets the earth
sky blue with white clouds sailing
jewelled with silver
<|endoftext|>

i am awaiting
perpetually and forever
a renaissance of wonder
<|endoftext|>

where is the horse and the rider where is the horn that was blowing
they have passed like rain on the mountain like wind in the meadow
the days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow
<|endoftext|>

memories so pure
life that was so beautiful
colours of sunset
<|endoftext|>

maple leaves reach out
for space and warm sunrays
a hand for comfort
<|endoftext|>

sparkles on water
from sunlight evening rays
shine like silver stars
<|endoftext|>

only the one now
hold on tight and remember
protect and cherish
<|endoftext|>

green is the colour
silent tree music plays here
time to stop and stare
<|endoftext|>

view across the vale
as far as the eye can see
yellow on yellow
<|endoftext|>

under sapphire blue sky
reflections of green leaved trees
bridge of serenity
<|endoftext|>

under azure sky
a small child stands on the stones
ancient abbey stones
<|endoftext|>

maytime bluebell time
sapphire stars of perfume
painted on welsh hills
<|endoftext|>

past years reflected
in these cold canal waters
for nine hundred years
<|endoftext|>

in evening's last light
a golden yellow lily
gleams a warm good night
<|endoftext|>

like a ship sailing
on the sea to distant lands
looking out on bay
<|endoftext|>

allways makes you imagine
how it would be
beeing in the departing boat
<|endoftext|>

here on golden pond
sunset glows as shining stars
glittering like pearls
<|endoftext|>

reflected
in the dragonfly's eye
mountains
<|endoftext|>

the finest qualities of our nature
like the bloom on fruits
can be preserved only by the most delicate handling
<|endoftext|>

born in jubilee
what a surprise this was for me
filly foal beauty
<|endoftext|>

through the sunlit trees
the old house stands guarding
beauty of this place
<|endoftext|>

billowing softly
sheets on summer lines drying
the laundress winds blow
<|endoftext|>

the primal duties shine aloft like stars
the charities that soothe and heal and bless
are scattered at the feet of man like flowers
<|endoftext|>

here they come for peace
blessing from the holy pope
spiritual love
<|endoftext|>

but it is not for thy valour only that i send thee
but to bring into the world a hope beyond thy sight
and a light that shall pierce the darkness
<|endoftext|>

theres rain in the window
there's sun in the painting
that smiles on the wall
<|endoftext|>

i go forth to seek
to seek and claim the lovely magic garden
where grasses softly sigh and muses speak
<|endoftext|>

rising from the earth
space like vision of beauty
treasure of plantlife
<|endoftext|>

i loved him so much
that plastic gecko was his
what was his name again
<|endoftext|>

in footsteps of old
follow young lives of now
under arches of stone
<|endoftext|>

land of heavens air
sunset clouds soft blue and gold
silver waves rippling
<|endoftext|>

a perchance to dream
hear singing of the sea birds
boats bobbing on tide
<|endoftext|>

out of summer air
with gold and black magic rings
came this dragonfly
<|endoftext|>

path down to sand beach
wild welsh winds seals and dolphins
place of harmony
<|endoftext|>

place of pilgrimage
church of the sea and the wind
resting quietly
<|endoftext|>

i believe in the sun even when it is not shining
i believe in love even when not feeling it
i believe in god even when he is silent
<|endoftext|>

little church of mwnt
shelter for pilgriming souls
a haven for all
<|endoftext|>

magical moments
wishes do come true for you
when you wait awhile
<|endoftext|>

ponies on the sand
summer evenings will soon end
racing to the sea
<|endoftext|>

sunlight fading fast
seagulls resting on the sands
time for going home
<|endoftext|>

every leaf speaks bliss to me
fluttering from
the autumn tree
<|endoftext|>

what does it mean  all  rocks
talking sky washed anew sand
crushed forever sun
<|endoftext|>

summer becomes fall
hot earth breathes sighs of relief
flowers set their seeds
<|endoftext|>

if music be the food of love play on
give me excess of it that surfeiting
the appetite may sicken and so die
<|endoftext|>

are you sure that eve
in the garden offered one
small apple only
<|endoftext|>

if you don't own a dog at least one
there is not necessarily anything wrong with you
but there may be something wrong with your life
<|endoftext|>

on the sea shore line
walking under setting sun
shadows of people
<|endoftext|>

only the gold sun
setting over the welsh sea
shimmering like silk
<|endoftext|>

light on the mountains
shadows in the green valleys
grey clouds in the sky
<|endoftext|>

only natures sounds
the cries of curlews and sheep
echoes of silence
<|endoftext|>

grey clouds in the sky
silver blue waters in pool
shadows reflecting
<|endoftext|>

lake of magic tales
light of heaven shining here
with soft autumn shades
<|endoftext|>

when i look upon your face
i realized the soft beauty
of quiet autumn days
<|endoftext|>

under autumn sky
white shades of trails and clouds
on shimmering blue lake
<|endoftext|>

shore sand pink horizon meet
watch silence appreciate nature's certainty become night
feel calmness descend on skin
<|endoftext|>

so then i took my turn
oh all the things i've done
and it was all yellow
<|endoftext|>

green gold autumn hues
shadows long with sun so low
distant sea and sky
<|endoftext|>

in this autumn morn
rusty reflections of trees
gliding of the swans
<|endoftext|>

emerald and gold
natures autumn songs are sung
in maple tree wood
<|endoftext|>

bright lights in the wood
shimmering in the shadows
leaves of maple tree
<|endoftext|>

copper medals shine
natures prizes for beauty
in magic beech leaves
<|endoftext|>

my thoughts were dancing
over the cloud dappled lake
of magic colours
<|endoftext|>

these are not plain leaves
these are colourful plane leaves
above the plane leaves
<|endoftext|>

colours of jewels
amber  ruby gold  silver
painted on the lake
<|endoftext|>

trees of rich colours
magical paradise view
apollos temple
<|endoftext|>

by a cross of stone
guarding this ancient vast place
play young lives of now
<|endoftext|>

the world is charged with the grandeur of god
it will flame out like shining from shook foil
it gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil
<|endoftext|>

catching shadows
on a warm autumn day
- such fleeting treasures
<|endoftext|>

restless clouds dancing
copper and jade trees sailing
mirror of the lake
<|endoftext|>

golden waters still
autumn leaves fading away
glimpse of mallard ducks
<|endoftext|>

dark shadows shining
shadows of gold and green shades
shadows of trees glow
<|endoftext|>

flash of a rainbow
jewels of ruby and gold
natures raw beauty
<|endoftext|>

mystery mountain
shrouded in misty clouds
pligrimage for souls
<|endoftext|>

snow topped mountains here
ancient giants of folklore
magic light and shadows
<|endoftext|>

on cold gusty winds
that tall trees sway and dance to
wintertime arrives
<|endoftext|>

but let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you
love one another but make not a bond of love
let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls
<|endoftext|>

end of the old year
renewal of clock of time
fading of the past
<|endoftext|>

golden eyes to stare
jet black like the darkest night
king of his domain
<|endoftext|>

wild ponies of wales
ancestors of the high hills
rooted in this place
<|endoftext|>

fading sunset light
soon magic hour will end
pure golden glow
<|endoftext|>

stillness in the air
snow carpeting the green fields
grey light shines from sky
<|endoftext|>

tall trees give shelter
in wind  rain and icy snow
guiding and guarding
<|endoftext|>

on snowy hill top
the shepherd watches his sheep
thinking and dreaming
<|endoftext|>

welsh flags are flying
on caerphilly castle walls
in the winters snow
<|endoftext|>

walking on the path
by snow covered welsh castle
a lady in red
<|endoftext|>

the old oak tree stands
protecting and sheltering
with its outstretched arms
<|endoftext|>

snow blankets the ridge
below billowing white clouds
sunlight and shadows
<|endoftext|>

at the tip of a curl
sweetness ignites the air
flash piont of nectar
<|endoftext|>

snow carpeted hill
people struggling up rock slopes
icy paths to tread
<|endoftext|>

low sunrays shining
golden sunset magic time
long winter shadows
<|endoftext|>

end of winters day
sun dying over the sea
golden memories
<|endoftext|>

the blue hour comes
twix sunset and darkness
magic time for you
<|endoftext|>

i've always thought
my flowers
had souls
<|endoftext|>

madness
and when you switch film backs and don't pay attention
this is what happens
<|endoftext|>

sheep speckled mountain
people treading the old paths
welsh black cattle graze
<|endoftext|>

icy welsh mountain
speckles on the high summit
just men and giants
<|endoftext|>

rocks and sand and sea
pools of icy cold water
winter memories
<|endoftext|>

love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself
loves possesses not nor would it be possessed
for love is sufficient unto love
<|endoftext|>

spring birth of nature
soft coloured mists fill the air
winter is fading
<|endoftext|>

wherever night falls
the earth is always
there to catch it
<|endoftext|>

sleeping trees waken
now lit with soft leaves of light
warming  the cold woods
<|endoftext|>

snow topped hills of wales
sheep grazing on the steep slopes
land of poetry
<|endoftext|>

no children playing
blanket of snow covering
no birds singing
<|endoftext|>

celebrate easter
resurrection from the earth
the gifts of new life
<|endoftext|>

silver dancer sways
slender branches blow in wind
sacred tree of old
<|endoftext|>

canal cottage walls
heavy hooves on the tow path
boat of bright colours
<|endoftext|>

seven hundred years
the abbey walls have listened
in prayer and silence
<|endoftext|>

falling around love
apogee and perigee
in complete orbit
<|endoftext|>

snow covers the floor
no roof to protect from storms
shelter from stone walls
<|endoftext|>

for two hundred years
horseshoe pass road twists and bends
hanging on mountain
<|endoftext|>

facing the mountains
southwards to the sun and sea
bodnant in beauty
<|endoftext|>

ancient stones watching
history remembering
people enjoying
<|endoftext|>

stone walls stand guarding
the old town of caernarfon
castle of beauty
<|endoftext|>

the steam train snaking
below snowdonia range
views for memories
<|endoftext|>

slate quarries now gone
cottage sleeping in the past
mountain memories
<|endoftext|>

windows on the world
past lives decayed in the past
locked still in the stones
<|endoftext|>

in serene silence
where buzzards soar in the sky
the white summer house
<|endoftext|>

twisting road through pass
mists of secret ancient times
mountains of giants
<|endoftext|>

mists of magic swirl
darkness and light in this place
in snowdonia
<|endoftext|>

reaching to the sky
beauty in its silent grace
protecting the graves
<|endoftext|>

seats to watch over
the precious sleeping children
with love and beauty
<|endoftext|>

first bluebells are here
rain and cold winds blow down on
scented sapphires
<|endoftext|>

the fountain is my speech
the tulips are my speech
the grass and trees are my speech
<|endoftext|>

new foal of pure gold
spirit of the high mountains
so wild and carefree
<|endoftext|>

spirited ponies
breathe the welsh air of heaven
peaceful in silence
<|endoftext|>

vacant green chair
pine needles whisked away
by a cool lake wind
<|endoftext|>

the green grass
and happy skies
court the fluttering butterflies
<|endoftext|>

watching the ponies
standing in the warm sunshine
moments of beauty
<|endoftext|>

the city is of night but not of sleep
there sweet sleep is not for the weary brain
the pitiless hours like years and ages creep
<|endoftext|>

do not go where the path may lead
go instead where there is no path
and leave a trail
<|endoftext|>

green pastures of wales
rolling down to blue waters
just bleating of sheep
<|endoftext|>

hear the bells ring
and the lapping of the waves
the sound of the sea
<|endoftext|>

blue sapphire sky
silver jewelled sparkling sea
summer at the beach
<|endoftext|>

power and beauty
towering above the beach
criccieth castle
<|endoftext|>

sweep of gold sands
sea washed with silver water
on the estuary
<|endoftext|>

glowing garden glens
glimmering green galleries
give gentle glances
<|endoftext|>

lake of welsh mountain
with tales of old history
land of the ancestors
<|endoftext|>

reaching to heaven
clouds of white billowing mists
so far yet so near
<|endoftext|>

free as bird that flies
where mountain peaks are so high
valleys  lakes and sea
<|endoftext|>

if i were a flower  i would be a sunflower
to always follow the sun turn my back to darkness
stand proud tall and straight even with my head full of seeds
<|endoftext|>

blue sky whispy clouds
sea serene and shimmering
evening by the sea
<|endoftext|>

they wait here for man
mysterious clouds of white swans
and spirits of monks
<|endoftext|>

necks arched in repose
stillness in the silent air
swan song of beauty
<|endoftext|>

feathers of soft silk
colours of clouds in the sky
silence of the swans
<|endoftext|>

sea waves silvery
jurrassic cliffs of old rock
treasures of the coast
<|endoftext|>

by box pond foxgloves
light up shadows in the woods
trees softly whisper
<|endoftext|>

come and walk with me
on bridge of tranquillity
and perfumed flowers
<|endoftext|>

meet at the arbour
looking over green woodlands
to distant landscape
<|endoftext|>

colour of deep calm
colour of life on this earth
colour of leaf birth
<|endoftext|>

silver sea soft sky
screech of seagulls special sounds
ponies in the surf
<|endoftext|>

seagulls are calling
sea waves crash in the distance
ponies cantering
<|endoftext|>

evening light now falls
seagulls resting on the shore
ponies going home
<|endoftext|>

a magical scene
dragonfly in summer sun
in an insect world
<|endoftext|>

i held you near
staring at me with huge eyes
then you flew away
<|endoftext|>

on silvery lake
the dancing clouds race in skies
where welsh hills do roam
<|endoftext|>

colourful vistas
an english country garden
in all its glory
<|endoftext|>

hour of sunset
special evening high tide
memories of past
<|endoftext|>

high tide and sunset
mysterious end of summer
watching and waiting
<|endoftext|>

penclawdd at day end
golden light fading on sea
marsh grasses hidden
<|endoftext|>

last light on water
sun sinking into the sea
evening high tide
<|endoftext|>

let them birds fly animals should not live in cages set them free
wild souls need freedom i'll save you
shooting my wonderful sister
<|endoftext|>

a black and white colt
sat beniethu00a0 blue skies and clouds
enjoying his day
<|endoftext|>

he appeared scrappy
with one eye and rugged frame
wearing rust suits him
<|endoftext|>

so small she was when
i planted her in the sun
to make evening shade
<|endoftext|>

its called a gods sky
when sun rays escape through clouds
as if from heaven
<|endoftext|>

when shadows begin
to eat the light at sunset
darkness will swallow
<|endoftext|>

color sky days blue
when big cotton candy clouds
make shapes in the sky
<|endoftext|>

such a handy bridge
for crossing tiny puddles
of left over rain
<|endoftext|>

scatter my ashes
in a field of wildflowers
when my time is done
<|endoftext|>

he knows his job well
collecting the mice and moles
in house and garden
<|endoftext|>

a pear cactus
meant for viewing
she will prick you good
<|endoftext|>

blue sky days often
turn into rainbow sunsets
with pink clouds nieth u00a0moon
<|endoftext|>

she keeps poetry
hidden away in a box
safe beneath her bedu00a
<|endoftext|>

her walls still hold on
to years of being a home
refusing to fall
<|endoftext|>

if not for the tree
standing alone in a field
there would be no shade
<|endoftext|>

if you want a prince
kiss a slimy frog like this
the story book said
<|endoftext|>

sometimes i enjoy
a slow ride home the back way
wind blowing my hair
<|endoftext|>

the sound of tadpoles
singing that late winter day
cured my winter blues
<|endoftext|>

after a snow storm
i love to be first to put
footprints in snow
<|endoftext|>

the storm seemed confused
black clouds lightening and thunder
brought hail in july
<|endoftext|>

she put a long tub
in the rose bed for herself
to soak at sunset
<|endoftext|>

shadows fall around
announcing a cloudy day
the sun is hiding
<|endoftext|>

the barn seems lonesome
without the house beside him
soon he too will fall
<|endoftext|>

i listen to wind
as it howls and bends the trees
whispering winter
<|endoftext|>

just before darkness
fireflies rise from the ground
as day bids farewell
<|endoftext|>

solar lights turn on
birds in tree tops are chatting
as day bids farewell
<|endoftext|>

the tin roof and rain
seem to play a pleasant song
in perfect rhythem
<|endoftext|>

she spends time peeping
looking out windows and doors
watching the neighbors
<|endoftext|>

i wanted to squash
the frog eating dragonflies
that blue june morning
<|endoftext|>

sunrise or sunset
the two are the same as one
both do a light show
<|endoftext|>

on warm sunny days
we still ride the old train cars
in our memory
<|endoftext|>

the old rusted truck
still wants to run in spite of
snow ice slush and sleet
<|endoftext|>

the old train car seemed
to be announcing that yes
red suits a caboose
<|endoftext|>

on bad weather days
shelter can always be found
in a covered u00a0bridge
<|endoftext|>

i took time today
to watch the sun slowly fall
into dark of night
<|endoftext|>

moss speaks in colors
touch of green says winters time
will soon be ending
<|endoftext|>

soon winter will go
march will be marching spring in
flowers are waiting
<|endoftext|>

the sky went crazy
blue and white mixed together
like a bowl of soup
<|endoftext|>

the snowman held on
getting smaller and smaller
refusing to melt
<|endoftext|>

late night morning light
holds on to darkness slowly
swallowed by the sun
<|endoftext|>

a tattered old barn
sits in the valleyu00a0 below
his time is not done
<|endoftext|>

god never tires
of the little oops in life
he loves to smile down
<|endoftext|>

old cat is tired
three fat moles he left today
next to my shovel
<|endoftext|>

they passed a law that
barns not advertise smoking
so tell them goodbye
<|endoftext|>

on warm moonlit nights
we turn on his radio
and bring him to life
<|endoftext|>

early spring is when
we search the woods for mushrooms
to fry in a pan
<|endoftext|>

pine trees collected
as much snow as they could hold
awaiting sunset
<|endoftext|>

she built her nest low
on a split rail fence of grapes
tucked under the leaves
<|endoftext|>

do her walls still hold
the laughter and chatter of
long ago children
<|endoftext|>

it still dont seem right
seven old men with a girl
who does all the chores
<|endoftext|>

orions only
constellation i can find
rest are all just stars
<|endoftext|>

yellows the only
primary color not here
it must be elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

classy graffiti
ann arbor boasts old masters
in downtown alleys
<|endoftext|>

orange doors: too good
to transform to usual
black and white image
<|endoftext|>

gas station maps were
free when i was a kid: now
quarters required
<|endoftext|>

can women eat here
not according to the sign
photo may be cropped
<|endoftext|>

some see black and white
some see many shades of gray
a few see color
<|endoftext|>

a perfect sunrise
or something unknown on fire
no escape for these
<|endoftext|>

in my mind the whole
state of new mexico looks
exactly like this
<|endoftext|>

where would the world be
without bottles to hold our
things rings hopes and dreams
<|endoftext|>

i would walk these stairs
just for the joy of color
and the rainbows end
<|endoftext|>

what must sea ones think
to see the strange lights drop down
into their dark world
<|endoftext|>

radiating lights
a lineup of containers
holding who knows what
<|endoftext|>

how often do we stop
to truly take in the meaning
of one time and place
<|endoftext|>

a crossing of lights
a pair of bold bright colors
does x mark the spot
<|endoftext|>

strange to know what lies
between the dates on the stone
is a persons life
<|endoftext|>

scroll work softens bars
allows the art element
to rise and endure
<|endoftext|>

squiggle graffiti
on a concrete block sidewall
says it all and more
<|endoftext|>

will any name work
for this fragile piece of art
call it beautiful
<|endoftext|>

caught in the quiet
and supreme understanding
of a holy place
<|endoftext|>

inviting oval
metal fringes like real leaves
respond to the wind
<|endoftext|>

sunshades and water
the perfect mix for a day
of lounging around
<|endoftext|>

not coincidence
the mating of old and new
someones planned design
<|endoftext|>

our view of the world
is forever colored by
the glass we look through
<|endoftext|>

what lies behind each
of these three doors can you guess
mysteries abound
<|endoftext|>

alien in scope
never judge a flower by
its unopened phase
<|endoftext|>

everything reaches
upward for the endless sky
eventually
<|endoftext|>

heres a lone building
heres a long lonely landscape
where are the people
<|endoftext|>

small glass squares shivered
in winters wind casting their
colors to the ground
<|endoftext|>

like the oceans waves
intricacies of past times
surge and then are gone
<|endoftext|>

a thing of the past
fine transoms above doorways
to let the wind speak
<|endoftext|>

chubby-cheeked angels
sing for their wine and supper
glorious delight
<|endoftext|>

ah shadows evoke
a more fascinating look
than the real object
<|endoftext|>

how do lines hold up
all that exquisite fine weight
it must be balance
<|endoftext|>

weathered textures blend
with earth-oriented shades
an open doorway
<|endoftext|>

blue wall closed window
curtains drawn against the heat
someone is sleeping
<|endoftext|>

all those glaring lights
and many still choose darkness
including the stars
<|endoftext|>

daylight meets lamplight
one starts where the other fails
few notice the change
<|endoftext|>

lines for making shade
looking like piano keys
metaphor for place
<|endoftext|>

heaven surely waits
for one so surrounded by
a lifetime of love
<|endoftext|>

valiant shrubbery
stays green even in winter
even with new snow
<|endoftext|>

what catches the eye
the angle of light on stairs
shows the way to go
<|endoftext|>

is g for god or
greatness goodness gratitude
generosity
<|endoftext|>

nested colored bowls
do not know anxiety
do not fear breakage
<|endoftext|>

alley passageway
look up for the only light
follow the bricks home
<|endoftext|>

insect art color
dew ridden still evolving
what will the wind bring
<|endoftext|>

new snow on a leaf
like granulated sugar
makes me want hot tea
<|endoftext|>

like an old tree trunk
the aging door demands our
sober attention
<|endoftext|>

my initial thought
like a yellow submarine
what goes on inside
<|endoftext|>

unusual sight
the underside of a cross
shifts our perception
<|endoftext|>

mysterious marks
try to hide an outlaw kick
creating odd art
<|endoftext|>

personified strength
meant to encourage passers by
dont forget the heart
<|endoftext|>

sacrificial lamb
a tiny death but one so
unforgettable
<|endoftext|>

green seascape green sky
even the rock glows with green
life and storm are one
<|endoftext|>

always mesmerized
by lights colors and textures
miracles appear
<|endoftext|>

everything is stripped
finally to bare essence
beauty evolving
<|endoftext|>

the message folded
into the shutters was the
mystery that day
<|endoftext|>

eat and walk through stuff
seems a pleasant enough time
where to wipe fingers
<|endoftext|>

dont you wish to know
the many things that happened
once upon a time
<|endoftext|>

rolled up in the sun
like natural tootsie rolls
good enough to eat
<|endoftext|>

new earth and old earth
a trio of guardians
a stone obelisk
<|endoftext|>

various colors
compliment the small towns life
always evolving
<|endoftext|>

the bird house weathered
many storms renovations
is anyone home
<|endoftext|>

weathered in ways we
cannot understand we leave
markers to follow
<|endoftext|>

not rain or dew drops
but the mark fog leaves behind
after soft kisses
<|endoftext|>

which way shall i look
what can i possibly see
not in front of me
<|endoftext|>

perspectives are changed
depending on the lights strength
to enter the glass
<|endoftext|>

natures true design
is to captivate the eye
and the roving mind
<|endoftext|>

creations exist
not for any real reason
except to be there
<|endoftext|>

a glimpse of branches
amidst the concrete and steel
walk slower and see
<|endoftext|>

religion for rent
please call if interested
perfect location
<|endoftext|>

who knew that chair backs
could create such an image
even in plastic
<|endoftext|>

a wreath of chiles
graces a welcome window
inviting you in
<|endoftext|>

see the lemon slice
so cool and casual near
the frosty glasses
<|endoftext|>

explosion of lights
could be almost anything
except sheer darkness
<|endoftext|>

round and round and round
a life of endless rolling
into the unknown
<|endoftext|>

long lonesome highway
extended forever view
makes a heart content
<|endoftext|>

cross against the sky
a small round stained-glass window
above unlocked doors
<|endoftext|>

serenity plus
everything anyone needs
to embrace pure peace
<|endoftext|>

forget the color
check out the startling textures
unpredicted art
<|endoftext|>

finally abandoned
not even a name to share
to remember when
<|endoftext|>

eventually
nature always takes back what
is rightfully hers
<|endoftext|>

mares tails in the sky
what divine storm created
bursts of sheer delight
<|endoftext|>

reflections shifting
forever changing whats real
from what is not
<|endoftext|>

the ways of the world
captured with intense color
guide us into light
<|endoftext|>

tin within tin rust
makes a big difference to
the blind-staring eye
<|endoftext|>

names and dates remain
all else fades away is gone
without one last sigh
<|endoftext|>

sensuality
existed long before our
knowledge of women
<|endoftext|>

is it the kings crown
or some sort of fine gentian
knowing wont matter
<|endoftext|>

what wondrous things
must have happened in this place
all memories now
<|endoftext|>

through a glass darkly
divided panes and true pain
all captured within
<|endoftext|>

decayed elegance
still contains subtle beauty
patina of time
<|endoftext|>

always womens work
grandmother mother and me
keeping the world clean
<|endoftext|>

of course the angels
play when no one else is there
perfectly in tune
<|endoftext|>

bricks board and metal
a tree refusing to die
still life still moment
<|endoftext|>

vibrant neon blue
a reflection of the sky
in many windows
<|endoftext|>

a puddles message
reflection of reflection
is all we need know
<|endoftext|>

a simple handshake
whats gone is gone   or is it
who will ever know
<|endoftext|>

heres the church and heres
the steeple the tree the sky
where are the people
<|endoftext|>

history cant wait
and a place knows where it is
no matter the map
<|endoftext|>

ghostly figures dance
beyond the broken windows
beg for attention
<|endoftext|>

such varied textures
create mystery landscape
that soon melts away
<|endoftext|>

many shapes colors
who knew that beans could become
unexpected art
<|endoftext|>

mystical waters
filling the gold hands of time
so purifying
<|endoftext|>

the red ties all of
this street-side scene together
such a nice gesture
<|endoftext|>

a mysterious
stair  scene from last nights dream  stops
before ground is reached
<|endoftext|>

new mexican spring
appearing on both sides of
screen as expected
<|endoftext|>

a table full of
rubies offers nourishment
for travelers eyes
<|endoftext|>

during a short lull
the servers have a minute
for their own breakfast
<|endoftext|>

one thing repeated
endlessly becomes stronger
than would first appear
<|endoftext|>

several genres
of urban art depicted
on only one block
<|endoftext|>

do you think that all
this time everything has been
just our lonely dreams
<|endoftext|>

a colorful range of
entertainment options tempt
the folks in boulder
<|endoftext|>

the water taxi
approaches in a blur of
crimson and bright white
<|endoftext|>

blueberry nights watched
over sleeping travelers
until the morning
<|endoftext|>

did they run out of
paint or realize they picked
a bad shade of green
<|endoftext|>

the cost of doing
business means keeping buildings
through the off season
<|endoftext|>

the placid pastel
saint presides over her world
always gazing up
<|endoftext|>

church literally
fell apart when methodists
left: its too late now
<|endoftext|>

tidal bore was less
than wed hoped but clouds
were lovely at least
<|endoftext|>

all that beach trash is
turning into oceanside
art installation
<|endoftext|>

spherical flower
buds tight pink fists waiting to
unfurl their beauty
<|endoftext|>

venus jupiter
and the ruins are lovely
this warm summer night
<|endoftext|>

window blinds pulled at
odd angle throw pacifics
blue light into room
<|endoftext|>

parking meters and
mural help blur line between
art everything else
<|endoftext|>

and so another day
ends spectacularly
as we hoped it would
<|endoftext|>

rocks and seaweed at
damp rest as the day slides
to ebony night
<|endoftext|>

sea spray on the glass
served to turn the view into
a water color
<|endoftext|>

things dont rust very
fast out here too arid  this
would have taken years
<|endoftext|>

in those very last
days before springs arrival
nothing was yet green
<|endoftext|>

candles in cross-shaped
candelabra provided
churchs only light
<|endoftext|>

its a long way down
to nothing: sometimes every
day feels like that
<|endoftext|>

easter eggshells on
the windowsill  their last stop
before compost bin
<|endoftext|>

calming properties
of blue lured them until they
forgot how to see
<|endoftext|>

things unraveling
at their own pace despite our
personal wishes
<|endoftext|>

would a mirror have
a crack to match the one thats
bisecting the wall
<|endoftext|>

a day so misty
that tiny water drops clung
to stems like jewels
<|endoftext|>

like a siren palm
garden lounge sings out to all
who are passing by
<|endoftext|>

solitary man
keeps company with football
and liquor bottles
<|endoftext|>

destructions despair
constructions hope  together
battle to the end
<|endoftext|>

moon escapes clawing
tree branches it always does
escape doesnt it
<|endoftext|>

hanging orbs catch sun
throw colors to anyone
needing light today
<|endoftext|>

one of many that
didnt meet expectations
failure  reminder
<|endoftext|>

magic about to
happen but i outside
alone and lonely
<|endoftext|>

those vivid color
patterns are offset by one
titling beer bottle
<|endoftext|>

the carnival ride
had a bit of a stutter
glad i was grounded
<|endoftext|>

self portrait dreams show
up at this mausoleum
in late afternoon
<|endoftext|>

charms: arms hearts and legs
are tacked to red wooden heart
hoping for lucks change
<|endoftext|>

hot dry summers will
bake paint right off the wood here
in new mexico
<|endoftext|>

light fixture turns blind
eye concedes to darkness lets
nighttime win again
<|endoftext|>

someone was fond of
yellow paint but paint alone
cant save walls ceilings
<|endoftext|>

inside the house: a
chair skeleton skeleton
of a dog outside
<|endoftext|>

a while since the scales
twenty pound graduations
mattered in the least
<|endoftext|>

all the blues came out
that day after the welcome
rainfall moved on east
<|endoftext|>

testing paint colors
or censoring graffiti
both are possible
<|endoftext|>

obviously the
sign pre-dates the wall-mounted
air conditioner
<|endoftext|>

my friend bonnie said
this is abstract art in the
sky shes right of course
<|endoftext|>

hotel balcony
perfect perch to watch mostly
nothing happening
<|endoftext|>

turquoise doors and trim
seem less hopeful since fading
peeling have set it
<|endoftext|>

chair working to keep
door open no way to know
why it would matter
<|endoftext|>

one hell of a step
and an arrow plus yellow
underground parking
<|endoftext|>

minimalism
of blues blending together
respite from winter
<|endoftext|>

the ad hoc groupings
oddly formal arrangement
pleasant to observe
<|endoftext|>

delicate versions
of previous vibrant shades
desert sun at work
<|endoftext|>

excellent arrow
term of highest praise  applies
to this example
<|endoftext|>

pacific islands
airport security is
lovely in this light
<|endoftext|>

this is the best sign
ever even though i dont know
what its promoting
<|endoftext|>

wait what happened here
three shots and in color too
i hope im ok
<|endoftext|>

weathered wooded cross
anchored by bits of color
and a bunch of rocks
<|endoftext|>

this arrangement of
crosses at a grave looks like
a wrought iron crown
<|endoftext|>

obligatory
iris  must post at least one
shot every springtime
<|endoftext|>

this thing i dont know
what it is  other than creepy
get me out of here
<|endoftext|>

blonde madonna guards
graves her calm patient face a
respite from it all
<|endoftext|>

night lights at grave site
comfort the living the dead
may not have noticed
<|endoftext|>

hotel courtyard  nice
place to relax when summer sun
is too much for you
<|endoftext|>

lavender midnight
blue: who says deserts are just
a single color
<|endoftext|>

postcard views are real
making a long trip worth the
effort that it took
<|endoftext|>

holiday motel
nice not expensive  wifi
kitchens and much more
<|endoftext|>

wavy lines somehow
make pointed shadows something
i cant figure out
<|endoftext|>

he gave up wearing
neckties when he retired but
kept them anyway
<|endoftext|>

no words can enhance
the south pacific night time
skies why even try
<|endoftext|>

rusts lovely colors
patterns can only mask the
certain destruction
<|endoftext|>

on this site winning
warriors ate their enemies
seasoned with breadfruit
<|endoftext|>

eerie glow from night
divers undulates through the
clear ocean water
<|endoftext|>

a desolate place
i stood on the porch to watch
the road it felt right
<|endoftext|>

the day breaks gently
this close to the equator
days nights are equal
<|endoftext|>

abandoned drive-in
lit by the glow of pink light
from a waning day
<|endoftext|>
