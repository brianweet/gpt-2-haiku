around the stove
<|endoftext|>

out of the garbage can
<|endoftext|>

near my house
<|endoftext|>

a cricket chirps while it sways 
a breeze carries dirty laundry

a long time to die
that is not today
<|endoftext|>

morning mizzle
the hawk mews growl
more like a dove
<|endoftext|>

shadows of clouds
and cleavage
at the cloud ridgetop
<|endoftext|>

passing thoughts
the moment a cuckoo
crows two more times
<|endoftext|>

no more today...
pigeons visiting
children who won't go

mixed precipitation
the crows' calls
less shrill
<|endoftext|>

no more today...
gibbous moon
or is that a gypsy?

mixed rain
and crows cries
rain or shine

midsummer stars
and gull songs

no moon
this day since

summer's end-
but for how long?
Cherry blossoms
fade
<|endoftext|>

chemo drip
just enough sugar
to make a snappy sweet
<|endoftext|>

winter sunset-
the grayness of the sky
and the snoring of the dragon
<|endoftext|>

wild rice blossoms-
a long time to wait
for another bite
<|endoftext|>

winter darkness
the string of crumbs
kicked out by a dog
<|endoftext|>

dog bark
ends the day with a hoot
Japanese cherry blossoms

spring's end-
before the storm dies down

harvest day
only the fresh snow

freckle patch-
the old fence-corn
less ghouls

spring's end-
on the hushed bell
chirping again

hurry-
on the halfpipe
the echoes of war

harvest moon
the stillness of dawn
olive leaves spread

Jormungand
on the snow-covered hill beside the ferry
<|endoftext|>

the moon during the darkness
its heat penetrates the sheet
<|endoftext|>

the silence
of the hurricane lights 
rain coats clatter to
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
between blasts
he flirts with his neighbour
<|endoftext|>

the end of June
two bald eagles
are more human
<|endoftext|>

in the sea
the rain ends
and weeds emerge
<|endoftext|>

long June night
an earwig clicks
and the moon rises
<|endoftext|>

on a giant screen
above the bar
my phone
<|endoftext|>

two-hour meeting 
his eyes on the clock
water from the same well
<|endoftext|>

June moon
our conversation ends
with the caller's name
<|endoftext|>

deep calm  
the worm crawls into the carrot
<|endoftext|>

cloudy June night
her bulging eyes
watch the train
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon 
she reads from a book
to herself
<|endoftext|>

long July morning
bombs raining down
on an already dark street
<|endoftext|>

cloudy June night
another phone call
from my daughter
<|endoftext|>

cloudy June night
another glass of wine
from my Santa
<|endoftext|>

cloudy June night
she tells me
she has a summer job
<|endoftext|>

cloudy June day
I bring out the deckchair
for a moment
<|endoftext|>

cloudy with rain...
another conversation
goes nowhere
<|endoftext|>

a glass of wine...
after the rain
rainbows
<|endoftext|>

cloudy...
another discussion
goes nowhere
<|endoftext|>

evening fog
a new set of spoons
at the kitchen table
<|endoftext|>

cloudy again
she tells me
she has a summer job
<|endoftext|>

dusk
the leaves are
slender
<|endoftext|>

distant thunder
I make dinner
for the kids
<|endoftext|>

the kids' room
wind chime softly
in the window
<|endoftext|>

July dawn
bubbles on the tiles
sunset over the bay
<|endoftext|>

sunny afternoon
the wind chimes
more clear
<|endoftext|>

sunset
she takes her shades off
sunset
<|endoftext|>

new moon
just enough daylight
for this walk
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon
two men speak
accent to one other
<|endoftext|>

morning confusion
the new calendar
meets the wall
<|endoftext|>

spring morning
my shadow thin
somewhere
<|endoftext|>

spring evening
birdsong
over the wind
<|endoftext|>

a bit of wind
becomes a lovely sphere
around my wind chime
<|endoftext|>

sunset
bubbles under water
the bottom of the sink
<|endoftext|>

blue sky
the moon a bit too
small for my hand
<|endoftext|>

evening fog
even more stars
than before
<|endoftext|>

a bit of cake
stirred into the milk jag
my mother's knife
<|endoftext|>

Christmas shopping
evening fog
wrapped in icing
<|endoftext|>

stormy night
the sound of a bird
far too loud
<|endoftext|>

my arch rival emerges
with his wife and two small girls
with him
<|endoftext|>

the snow covers
the windowsill
with its emptiness
<|endoftext|>

a bit of cake
steals the sunshine
from my cheeks
<|endoftext|>

the sound of voices
fades into the wind-
another cup of coffee

in a headstone
<|endoftext|>

whenever I look
the same way
when you talk

The same face

A fabric softener
front and center

in the twilight
flutes flailing on the vibraphone
scent of fireflies
<|endoftext|>

over teak I installed
a firefly
a thousand leagues
<|endoftext|>

warm rain
old oak boards
attached
to the wall
<|endoftext|>

firefly
her pixie cut
perfectly encapsulated
in your hug

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 pet from the
nameless corpse
<|endoftext|>

stuck in traffic
slowly words come out
of her teen years
<|endoftext|>

subway window
the winter sky
wrapped in ice
<|endoftext|>

amid the night
the ice melts
and the snow
<|endoftext|>

the ice
molds itself around
me and you
<|endoftext|>

the ice
seeps slowly from pipe
before the warm sun
<|endoftext|>

between the worlds
and the miller
farewell
<|endoftext|>

gives place to
a large, white house
oblivious bird
<|endoftext|>

house for sale
close by the row
of blackbirds
<|endoftext|>

a row of blue irises
glitters in the moonlight
flow briskly
<|endoftext|>

Sunday night
seven shades of sepia
chromic aqua
<|endoftext|>

evening tea
the crack in the wall
between my bedroom and the street
<|endoftext|>

still river
after the foam
the water appears
<|endoftext|>

before the storm
in the house's shadow
a pale yellow rose
<|endoftext|>

a winged ant
crawls on the kitchen floor
first emperor crab
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
an orange iris
rings my mc's
<|endoftext|>

overcast
tai wai te kilua ailan
niwi wa nai
<|endoftext|>

na wa nai
tadashi no atashi
hikari no ote ga
<|endoftext|>

after the storm
the taste of lemonade
in my coffee
<|endoftext|>

october sun
a red leaf hangs
in the pine
<|endoftext|>

color spot
a violet river
goes blue
<|endoftext|>

locavore
wintering in the front
house only half empty
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the best way to boil an egg
is by hand
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the smell of wood after a fire
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

haiku
after the flood
the road changes
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the smell of wood after a fire
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
a hawk on a fence post
almost free
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the chilly feeling
in my hand
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the rain on the side
of the road
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the sediment under
my shoe
<|endoftext|>

end of the shift
he says hi
to the ghost of old
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
as he smoothens the rust
from the nail
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the rain on the other
pallet
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the puppy's face
as he learns to crawl
<|endoftext|>

grain of truth
the shadow of the cloud
starry night
<|endoftext|>

end of the shift
she shares
its own yarn
<|endoftext|>

a heather for the coffee
stopped just short
of maple
<|endoftext|>

colder days
the coffee still tastes
like coffee
<|endoftext|>

spring evening
the cat watches
the granite in the window
<|endoftext|>

a young maple leaf
strewn with snow
summer rain
<|endoftext|>

how silent
this autumn morning
the ache
of your shoulder
<|endoftext|>

gentle breaths
as you brighten
fewer clouds
<|endoftext|>

millennium moon
the childhood passed
so fast
<|endoftext|>

lever one...
...the moon
on the bicycle
<|endoftext|>

after the party
the sound of
water changing
its colour

day breaks
I write
a haiku
in old shoddy ink
<|endoftext|>

morning haze
she's still wearing
her chiffon nightgown
<|endoftext|>

first frost warning
the subway is full
of snowflakes
<|endoftext|>

heavy slant line
the harbor breeze is
the best lover
<|endoftext|>

distant fireworks
one hot November night
all the stars
<|endoftext|>

the year
not included
in your free copy
freezin up
<|endoftext|>

heavy summer rain
the cat continues
to sleep
<|endoftext|>

dawn
a few sparse red specks
in the morning mist

local sport
the still head of a once
bearded cat
<|endoftext|>

local sport
the older, faster,
the most beautiful

beginning
the younger, faster,
saying the same
<|endoftext|>

local sport
the throwing of the
gymnasium's
old dice 
<|endoftext|>

gymnasium
dved on the way
the throw of a towel
<|endoftext|>

snow turns to rain
the coming and go
of the bedraggled
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
the reflection's
gripes for divorce
<|endoftext|>

empty
dormant
the pluck of your words
<|endoftext|>

gym pass
the scent of
pine leaves

only the wind

home renovation

Spring thaw
the slow drip-drip

<|endoftext|>

Cautiously the cat
in the dark of night
Pray for a cockroach
<|endoftext|>

Come morning,
follow the mate
the ash worm
<|endoftext|>

Too hot to sleep
Cooler still
the afternoon stars
<|endoftext|>

This cold night
I dream I see
a cockroach on the bar
<|endoftext|>

First day of the year
the jasmine
in abundance
<|endoftext|>

Pretty face
the undertaker's
whip
<|endoftext|>

Between the songs
a wind chime bluer
than the flames
<|endoftext|>

While reading the book
a blackbird's
singing voices 
<|endoftext|>

Pressing a seed
in my curly hair
year of moon
<|endoftext|>

While bathing in moonlight
a dragonfly
comes out

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
the
<|endoftext|>


summer's end-
an unfamiliar face
on the veranda
<|endoftext|>

the last ball of wax
drops out of an old hand
this night
<|endoftext|>

shortwave radio...
we hope the storm will pass
tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

silence...
the rain over
takes up your silence
<|endoftext|>

dusk-
the last star among the constellations
of the night
<|endoftext|>

echo
in the storm sewer
nothing but dust
<|endoftext|>

evening storm screen
the hawk's reflection
in the hole
<|endoftext|>

silence
the screen bat Wingate
leavers
<|endoftext|>

the night side
Of the pub window
The pavement smells different
<|endoftext|>

silence
the wind scatters our lamps
again
<|endoftext|>

drifting
from house to house
the call of the cross
<|endoftext|>

resetting of the clocks
the neighbors again
together
<|endoftext|>

monday dawn
stimulate a spring rain
in a teacup
<|endoftext|>

a reminder
that again this morn
I will miss you
<|endoftext|>

first sunrise
Let spring again
the teacup
<|endoftext|>

low tide -
back and forth
the dishwasher
<|endoftext|>

home for Christmas
behind the thick cement
the smell of cinnamon
<|endoftext|>

dusk-
a window to the garden
opens out
<|endoftext|>

multiply my caution
and trust me, you will need them both
against failure
<|endoftext|>

fail safe -
a can of worms in
the cup of tea
<|endoftext|>

dusting off -
the traces of a mole
on the carpet
<|endoftext|>

the cart woman-
the second skin
on the boss
<|endoftext|>

the mound of snow
after the storm
a ghost town
<|endoftext|>

turn off the prying
and listen closely
the rain in wisps
<|endoftext|>

autumn morning
the spider's web stays
sharp
<|endoftext|>

stormy seas...
I look out the window
half-dressed
<|endoftext|>

moon on the wane -
the second hand
on the dial
<|endoftext|>

autumn deepens -
the sound of water
splash[ing]
<|endoftext|>

sunrise
the old pen pal
uses Change
<|endoftext|>

morning sun
the silence of the moon
on the river
<|endoftext|>

June
how many stars do
I see?
<|endoftext|>

moon phase
the old cat
wakes up
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
the leaf pile-up
is a neighborhood
<|endoftext|>

I see into
the shadow of a flower
in the grass
<|endoftext|>

white fog
the middle of the night
is cold
<|endoftext|>

a bright morning
glasses on
the table
<|endoftext|>

before the luau -
a winged eagle
preys
<|endoftext|>

the basket
floats in the water
last night's buyer
<|endoftext|>

funeral procession
the rain of flowers
gibbous moon
<|endoftext|>

before the crematorium -
the slow tick of a clock
as time passes
<|endoftext|>

Crematorium -
the slow tick of a clock
as time passes
<|endoftext|>

fog -
the moon
in the room
<|endoftext|>

Mass with Joan Baez
street background fades out
when she talks
<|endoftext|>

the basket
fills the air -
the moon
<|endoftext|>

her hair done
and tan lines

late night
fireflies rise up
in the cemetery
<|endoftext|>

cool breeze
smells of burning leaves
and cardboard
<|endoftext|>

My 50th birthday
somewhere else in the world
unanswered SMSs
<|endoftext|>

Lighting the whole sky
candle raid winter
Summer solstice
<|endoftext|>

Summer thunderstorm -
the one with the Greek letter
it seems more like a snail
<|endoftext|>

Summer solstice
this summer heat still
feeling of freezing
<|endoftext|>

still feeling summer...
she sent me another SMS
talking about
the fireworks
<|endoftext|>

Summer thunder...
this summer dream of hers
so big from room to room
the tick of a clock
<|endoftext|>

somewhere else in the dream
the same music as always
kitchen chair
<|endoftext|>

kitchen chair...
sending and receiving
smilies these skies
<|endoftext|>

bird songs...
how fragile
our friendship
<|endoftext|>

cracks in the snow
a few yellow wings
after the jet
<|endoftext|>

time passes...
the gaps between memories
bigger than before
<|endoftext|>

blue sky
nothing but stars
after the eclipse
<|endoftext|>

a slow progress
the steady progress of the moon
into darkness
<|endoftext|>

the moon takes a nap
the progress of the train
into the night
<|endoftext|>

the moon passes
the horizon into darkness
the coarse outline
of a shore
<|endoftext|>

the imprint of my hand
on the cold crystal moon
this bright night
<|endoftext|>

in the depths
of her scarf she gathers
sharo
<|endoftext|>

this son's bright side
That he's not here
all the time
<|endoftext|>

Young sun...
playing on the edge
between day and night
<|endoftext|>

Young sun...
the noise of the wind
against the wall
<|endoftext|>

awake at night
my clothes are never seen
the road less traveled
<|endoftext|>

farmer's market
cold hands touch
cartouches
<|endoftext|>

foggy morning
she asks if
she can lie
<|endoftext|>

vacation home
the moon shines
on the window
<|endoftext|>

waning moon...
she starts crying
about her dad
<|endoftext|>

mountain storm
I think of all the things
I did during
the eclipse
<|endoftext|>

the eclipse continues
I forget
I am on fire
<|endoftext|>

fireworks
in the clouds
my father's grave
<|endoftext|>

eclipse:
the whole sky
blue
<|endoftext|>

spring day
watching the crowd
catch fire
<|endoftext|>

a blue morse code
starts to move
spring sun
<|endoftext|>

foggy day
I pee on the rug
to cool off
<|endoftext|>

a rainbow breaks
the smell of food
from restaurant
<|endoftext|>

dog days 
my wife and I explore
unexplored territory
<|endoftext|>

cold snap 
a sliver of sunshine

Slowly
on the wire
the descent of a cedary tree

In the bowl of tea
The shadow of age

His name
on the black and white striped

<|endoftext|>

A drop tumbled
onto the pavement

In the shears
the reek of victory
<|endoftext|>

Reaching
for the old knife
danna no
<|endoftext|>

The old path
Passing through
pines
<|endoftext|>

The old sword
In the shears she clasps
<|endoftext|>

Here and there
flake of a sun
in the sky
<|endoftext|>

On the marble
a crown of thorns
Haiti
<|endoftext|>

That night our voices
almost the same
Haiti
<|endoftext|>

Red poppies
in three different directions
Haiti
<|endoftext|>

One more star
in the heavens

On the scale

and cheese

Winter storm watch
the sound of falling leaves
harder
<|endoftext|>

Winter storm watch
the whistle of a distant train
harder
<|endoftext|>

On the window
three colors of jasmine
Cui bono?
<|endoftext|>

In the hall
full moon
and mist
<|endoftext|>

Early autumn
with the bird on the fence
ew woudll make much of it
<|endoftext|>

Red sky
the shadow of a fir moves
Cui bono?
<|endoftext|>

Winter moon
the flower of a tree
wets'owned
<|endoftext|>

On the mantelpiece
on which I laid
a lei
<|endoftext|>

Moon rain
the shadow of a teacup
drunk
<|endoftext|>

The rose
whose petals we scattered
mickael wint
<|endoftext|>

In her lap
his trademark red jacket
Mickael wint
<|endoftext|>

The river
flatly refuses to rise
Mickael wint

<|endoftext|>

dark days of winter
the single minded focus
of a saw
<|endoftext|>

warm rain on the riverigo
i remember the smell
of freshly cut grass
<|endoftext|>

the smell of water from the well
before the flies
in the windy weather
<|endoftext|>

before leaving
a little girl reads
one line of poetry
<|endoftext|>

moonless night
a tree's shadow
minutes between knocks
<|endoftext|>

noise of chains
an old man lumbers
up the steps
<|endoftext|>

roosting egrets
two big, black flies
watch the dial
<|endoftext|>

starless night
a post office clerk
lists her mail
<|endoftext|>

morning mist
the nurse flicks water
from his sore throat
<|endoftext|>

hunger moon
so many dark things
inside
<|endoftext|>

haze
raindrops
fall from the sky
<|endoftext|>

rain
glide
on the rail bridge
<|endoftext|>

raking the leaves
windless sky-
the gray spot
<|endoftext|>

low tide-
the neighborhood cemetery
and me
<|endoftext|>

the season of pine
ends.
Shia La'am
and the crows.
<|endoftext|>

around the bend
still the car
on the highway
<|endoftext|>

tree depth
the mournful wail
of a bird
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon
the fullness
of her breasts
<|endoftext|>

my son's side
in the passenger's seat
a beautiful rose
<|endoftext|>

rose petals
flutter in the wind -
mourning doves
<|endoftext|>

autumn butterfly
   a  c light                                                                                                                                                       ?

rose petals
flutter in the wind -
   a few empty rose petals
at the kitchen table
<|endoftext|>

after the vacation
   the moon
now in the eastern sky
<|endoftext|>

distant thunder
   the grinding of
reclaimed coffee
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
   the knot of my son's
ears
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
seagulls are white
in summer's wind
<|endoftext|>

no more pictures
of my husband
death scene
<|endoftext|>

between two rivers
woodpeckers
