twines across the sky
the northbound train departs
<|endoftext|>

dawn chorus begins
I reach for
the snooze button
<|endoftext|>

en haut des cuisses
dans l'espace sous le slip
un morceau de mer

new March snow
the grouse with a missing toe
still around
<|endoftext|>

Remembrance Day-
even the traffic
pauses for 2 minutes
<|endoftext|>

21-gun salute-
mortar fire echoes
in his eyes
<|endoftext|>

dignified march-
veterans and peacekeepers
pass the applause
<|endoftext|>

morning commute-
headlights fade
in the whiteout
<|endoftext|>

with the terns
<|endoftext|>

yellow walnut leaves
slowly appear on the lawn
early morning light
<|endoftext|>

one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work
<|endoftext|>

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze 
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

summer clouds 
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti
<|endoftext|>

rabbit and the hawk -
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red
<|endoftext|>

quick mid-winter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace
<|endoftext|>

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog
<|endoftext|>

shoots of green grain-
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway
<|endoftext|>

dirtballs, dust and clay
a drilling rig's relentless motion
<|endoftext|>

through autumn's dusk
the computer wanes and hums
one hundred crows
<|endoftext|>

autumn deepens
we gather the few
remaining seeds
<|endoftext|>

an aroma
of green walnuts
summer dusk
<|endoftext|>

100 degree heat
country-western music
from the asian bar
<|endoftext|>

reaching
for a new found warmth
sweet rhubarb cake 
<|endoftext|>

she's found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring
<|endoftext|>

distant voices
a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow
<|endoftext|>

solo trip
in the campfire smoke
old memories
<|endoftext|>

long ago
I threw your letters away
footprints in snow
<|endoftext|>

afraid of a boy
with an old man's eyes
needles of frost
<|endoftext|>

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold half-moon
<|endoftext|>

dull in a crescent's light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood
<|endoftext|>

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon
<|endoftext|>

sunflower
the day passing
slowly
<|endoftext|>

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day
<|endoftext|>

my sister's voice
from half a continent
away
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
the bluebird's call
clearly audible
<|endoftext|>

the wasp
trapped between panes of glass
first spring light
<|endoftext|>

floats in my cup
white sake
<|endoftext|>

temperature rising

through the north window
<|endoftext|>

homeless
pushing a cart along

<|endoftext|>

a line of coal cars 
viewed from the railroad bridge 
returning chill
<|endoftext|>

in my alley
<|endoftext|>

taking a bite
from a bitter orange

comforts his dog
<|endoftext|>

these old buildings
cast long shadows

in the parking lot car lights
dim near morning
<|endoftext|>

what day is this?

in the corner
<|endoftext|>

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker 
<|endoftext|>

no work today
a carpenter ant wanders
aimlessly
<|endoftext|>

customers discuss
philosophy 
<|endoftext|>

garage sale
'tales of power'
for half price
<|endoftext|>

taiko drummers
listening to silence
between the beats
<|endoftext|>

no moon, no stars,
just dull light from the city
summer haze
<|endoftext|>

lost
on wildwood road
water lilies directionless
<|endoftext|>

suddenly
the toads go quiet
rain begins
<|endoftext|>

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea
<|endoftext|>

rabbit trail
nothing but ears
above the snow
<|endoftext|>

firecrackers
far off in the distance
pepper on my tongue
<|endoftext|>

between the drone
of lawnmowers
a scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

returning chill
dissonate melodies
from the ice cream truck
<|endoftext|>

waiting for the moon
before departing
ducks on the roof

crying and then laughter teen
Employment quest
<|endoftext|>

muddy grave -
the rich scent of roses
so red
<|endoftext|>

full moon -
the bride tells me
it was forced
<|endoftext|>

lingering cold...
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf
<|endoftext|>

fridge magnet -
snack after snack
wasting away
<|endoftext|>

advanced Parkinsonism
she wipes his dribbling saliva
remembers his kisses
<|endoftext|>

long barge
slow on the canal
the moon
<|endoftext|>

almost lost
among the shifting hues
of dusk
the faint calligraphy
of swans
<|endoftext|>

my dying mother's words
come back to me 
<|endoftext|>

august wind
on the dock seagulls
stand on two legs
<|endoftext|>

sudden downpour -
the memory of a butterfly
washed away
<|endoftext|>

the corridor
was long and dark...
news of your death
closer
with each step
<|endoftext|>

from one year
to another -
the same moon
<|endoftext|>

day moon -
the distance between us
full of silence
<|endoftext|>

A rippled moon :
In the pond, 
A sinking stone.
<|endoftext|>

Lighting the room,
candle by candle
a winter evening.
<|endoftext|>

my umbrella
flipped in the windâ€“
uncertain days
<|endoftext|>

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog
<|endoftext|>

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown
<|endoftext|>

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky
<|endoftext|>

sweet cream and wrinkle remover
in the shopping cart
<|endoftext|>

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side
<|endoftext|>

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight
<|endoftext|>

clothes dried on the line-
a spring morning
still in the folds
<|endoftext|>

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth
<|endoftext|>

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries
<|endoftext|>

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand
<|endoftext|>

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows
<|endoftext|>

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring
<|endoftext|>

the discussion stops
for a robin
<|endoftext|>

in an empty room

with tangerine peels
<|endoftext|>

with a cool breeze
<|endoftext|>

cold sunshine

tucked into itself
<|endoftext|>

sold out
<|endoftext|>

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page
<|endoftext|>

drifting
from somewhere
pear blossoms
<|endoftext|>

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring
<|endoftext|>

road closed
moose tracks continue on
local traffic only
<|endoftext|>

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow
<|endoftext|>

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes
<|endoftext|>

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses
<|endoftext|>

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn
<|endoftext|>

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath
<|endoftext|>

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire
<|endoftext|>

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age
<|endoftext|>

bouquets of lilacs
the last bunch fills
a milk bottle
<|endoftext|>

twilight rain
the scent of lilacs
through the window
<|endoftext|>

dead heading lilacs
the fragrance lingers
in memory
<|endoftext|>

strong winter wind
bits of Batman kite wings
fall from the tree
<|endoftext|>

April warmth-
a new crop of dandelions
since yesterday
<|endoftext|>

an ant in my bed-
for the two of us
not enough room
<|endoftext|>

Hurricane Irene
in the semi-darkness
a cold breakfast
<|endoftext|>

heavy time
slowly ticking the minutes
Hurricane Irene
<|endoftext|>

Fourth of July
watching fireflies
on the lawn
<|endoftext|>

between morning chores
I open the door-
lilacs in the rain
<|endoftext|>

the neighbor's lilacs-
gathering the fragrance
to myself
<|endoftext|>

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice
<|endoftext|>

blank date book-
the gray afternoon
turns to white
<|endoftext|>

sleet and rain-
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush
<|endoftext|>

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain
<|endoftext|>

early autumn
the sound of falling water
is cold
<|endoftext|>

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time-
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

cricket in the house-
if only we shared
the same bedtime
<|endoftext|>

the Thanksgiving meal -
after eating the talk
slows down
<|endoftext|>

black-out
the holiday glow
of fireflies
<|endoftext|>

black-out
in my neighbor's house
a room to room glow
<|endoftext|>

in the back alley
school-kids puffing away
in the shadow of a chimney
<|endoftext|>

riverside promenade 
seniors stroll through
falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

a koi rises
to meet a falling leaf -
autumn afternoon
<|endoftext|>

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections
<|endoftext|>

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field...
journey's end.
<|endoftext|>

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh
february rains
<|endoftext|>

high tide
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves
<|endoftext|>

january freeze
koi chase each other
above the television
<|endoftext|>

groundhog day...
sharing a sausage
with friends
<|endoftext|>

autumn seabreeze...
a film of salt forms
on his glasses
<|endoftext|>

grey morning...
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog
<|endoftext|>

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree...
white snow cover
<|endoftext|>

new widescreen tv:
watching junk in
high definition
<|endoftext|>

winter day's end... 
a bowl of brown rice miso, 
warm in the hands
<|endoftext|>

homework 
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds
<|endoftext|>

december warm spell
the neighborhood snowmen
are all plastic
<|endoftext|>

frosty meadow 
another dawn
reaches across
<|endoftext|>

between sips... 
reading a book 
about sake
<|endoftext|>

her piano-playing 
comes to an end... 
sounds of autumn hail
<|endoftext|>

first snowfall
the dog's legs
have become shorter
<|endoftext|>

first snowfall...
here is a christmas card
to be mailed, last year
<|endoftext|>

at a desk,
i write
this ku
<|endoftext|>

a bluejay takes flight
the neighbour's car
needs washing
<|endoftext|>

grey sky
a monarch butterfly
lost in autumn
<|endoftext|>

after the guests leave
the lilies
open
<|endoftext|>

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road
<|endoftext|>

old pond
after the frog
the stillness
<|endoftext|>

frost
on the spent firework casing
new year's day
<|endoftext|>

flashing
<|endoftext|>

frozen in time
<|endoftext|>

under my bench 
<|endoftext|>

on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp
<|endoftext|>

in the morning light
the snail's last movements
<|endoftext|>

elevator
an ex's scent
hanging
<|endoftext|>

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat
<|endoftext|>

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest
<|endoftext|>

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee
<|endoftext|>

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution
<|endoftext|>

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea 
<|endoftext|>

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks
<|endoftext|>

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak 
<|endoftext|>

long journey back home 
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away
<|endoftext|>

April 2nd

still lying 
<|endoftext|>

two dog walkers
meet -
two conversations
<|endoftext|>

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse -
still the new shoots
<|endoftext|>

on the fireman's helmet
a faint smell of smoke
<|endoftext|>

frozen dawn
the runner recovering
in his own steam 
<|endoftext|>

at the side of the road
wild damsons
<|endoftext|>

Caruso recording -
the gramophone crackle
lights the fires in his eye
<|endoftext|>

the police car slows -
suburban foxes
looting from bins
<|endoftext|>

restless -
across the summer night
siren upon siren
<|endoftext|>

still the spent firework's
cordite smell -
nest of serpents
<|endoftext|>

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line
<|endoftext|>

the name
I didn't want to see -
bitter coffee
<|endoftext|>

airborne again -
the roadkill's
feathers 
<|endoftext|>

road trip
at the end of the argument
a patch of blue
<|endoftext|>

the heather still in bloom -
we take Mum the long way
back to the hospice
<|endoftext|>

chuntering at something
the blackbird on the fence post
- election day
<|endoftext|>

weaving its way
through the rush hour traffic
a white butterfly
<|endoftext|>

bringing only
silence
the storm cloud's weight
<|endoftext|>

roadside memorial -
the faded plastic windmills
still racing
<|endoftext|>

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day
<|endoftext|>

darker
<|endoftext|>

A spring morning
The pond's surface blurred
By raindrops.

Orion's bow
<|endoftext|>

late night at the office
an exit sign floats
next to the moon

dark tree silhouettes
low on the horizon
Orion rises
<|endoftext|>

Distant thunder

all lit up
<|endoftext|>

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd
<|endoftext|>

a vagabond on the bench
covered with a nude girl
on the newspaper
<|endoftext|>

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen
<|endoftext|>

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

after the long wait...
  two unattended dove eggs
      in summer rain
<|endoftext|>

from the armoire,
scent of passion in a candle
yet to be burned
<|endoftext|>

mid October
the sudden thinness
of my robe
<|endoftext|>

wood flute music
through an open window
the crow's rasp
<|endoftext|>

cold May moon... the long road stretches out of sight
<|endoftext|>

mothers' day
I let the phone ring longer
for her
<|endoftext|>

scenting two pages
of the Webster's Unabridged...
wild lilac
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's dinner
nothing on the menu
suits him
<|endoftext|>

stroke of ...
his snoring punctuated
by fireworks
<|endoftext|>

stillness...
a few flat stones
beneath the pine
<|endoftext|>

purple irises
stand still
rain or shine
<|endoftext|>

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation
<|endoftext|>

distant thoughts-
the last ember
cools
<|endoftext|>

more wine?
he places an afghan
around my shoulders
<|endoftext|>

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain
<|endoftext|>

cold May moon...
the long road stretches
out of sight 
<|endoftext|>

deeper into autumn
she aches for an honest touch
<|endoftext|>

heat storm
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance
<|endoftext|>

April shower -
last drop
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

Morning fog -
only the scent of
eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

rain all day stacks of old magazines closer to the door
<|endoftext|>

church ruins
the grace
of a butterfly
<|endoftext|>

pleasantly drunk
in the orchard
a flock of waxwings
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn
<|endoftext|>

hawk's hover -
the view of calm seas
through a gunport
<|endoftext|>

overcast night
maybe the stars burn brightly
over Gaza
<|endoftext|>

at the memorial
a hawk's cry
scatters her ashes
<|endoftext|>

forty-six years
writing my name
yellow in snow
<|endoftext|>

glimmer of revival
at the window
full moon
<|endoftext|>

sunny terrace
forget Christmas
oncoming
<|endoftext|>

on the gray tarmac
in the rain back
yellow bus
<|endoftext|>

does not make his bed
undo the
day return
<|endoftext|>

watching seagulls
search the market remains
imagine the sea
<|endoftext|>

at the other end of the world
on the train window
Race raindrops
<|endoftext|>

under the endless rain
the gray spot
the colors of the arena
<|endoftext|>

with my dad
speak to learn to grow old
- The smell of clematis
<|endoftext|>

Chat of joggers...
the heron and I
motionless
<|endoftext|>

March night
listen to the rain
crashing on the tiles
<|endoftext|>

subway platform
the beggar snores
his bottle stands
<|endoftext|>

in the middle of the night
the hum of the ventilation
between two sirens blaring
<|endoftext|>

first day of autumn
the sun hits the tile
one last time
<|endoftext|>

Lost in the hubbub
on the opposite platform
the shouting match
<|endoftext|>

anonymous signature
old pigeon footprints
the bare cement
<|endoftext|>

Monday in October
in and out of the subway
without seeing the day
<|endoftext|>

Metro Morning
this urine odor
tenacious
<|endoftext|>

red tasks first
on the hillside
sun on my cheek
<|endoftext|>

heavy sleep
after plum alcohol
collected in his garden
<|endoftext|>

breathing deeply...
that smell of woodyards
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

I saw the horizon
in the subway
in four by three
<|endoftext|>

the sound of rain
drown the echo of my footsteps
autumn morning
<|endoftext|>

from room to room
the mouse moves
without worrying about us
<|endoftext|>

iced or hot tea
I hesitate
last day of August
<|endoftext|>

it is no longer
cold tap water
heat wave
<|endoftext|>

sitting on the ground
her bare shoulder
armless
<|endoftext|>

three cardboard pieces
scattered
remains monte
<|endoftext|>

a snail adventure
the still hot asphalt
June storms
<|endoftext|>

sad sandwich
fell from a machine
soulless
<|endoftext|>

the only lights on
in a passive fight
against the darkness of the whole building
<|endoftext|>

new snow
I Almost forget
our quarrel
<|endoftext|>

shirtless window
I read haikus
summer rain
<|endoftext|>

just for a moment
the smell of pine trees
way to work
<|endoftext|>

early in the morning
looking at fog
partner after the wedding
early morning
watching the fog
after marriage
<|endoftext|>

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her
<|endoftext|>

nothing more tiring
than Being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee
<|endoftext|>

crushed mosquito
red line on the floor
subway in may
<|endoftext|>

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath
<|endoftext|>

the coin
as cold as the machine
which to me made
<|endoftext|>

Black jacket
under trees
with pink flowers
<|endoftext|>

in the train
all the scents of the morning
overshadowed by the tramp asleep
<|endoftext|>

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits
<|endoftext|>

white
the pages of my notebooks
I do not like winter
<|endoftext|>

nose in the air
fixing the invisible
bum perched
<|endoftext|>

listen to the rain
next to my phone
quiet
<|endoftext|>

at Rise
piss in the autumn wind
make a haiku
<|endoftext|>

first flakes
think of my father
on his hospital bed
<|endoftext|>

my cold bed
my skin looking hers
first flakes
<|endoftext|>

stroking the cat
a cold drop
my neck
<|endoftext|>

sad smile
the line of bum who sleeps
on the subway platform
<|endoftext|>

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light -
even fresh flowers, fade
<|endoftext|>

five star hotel -
a cockroach scurries
pool-side
<|endoftext|>

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog
<|endoftext|>

his old hands
working the soil -
smell of brewed tea
<|endoftext|>

on the clothesline
his and her shirts
side by side again
<|endoftext|>

between the mist
and the edge of the forest
a white buffalo
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
rose garden
has lost its colors 
<|endoftext|>

eerie moonlight
graveyard
of the rusted automobiles
<|endoftext|>

indian summer
first light
finds the tallest tree
<|endoftext|>

drought
no clouds
in the bird bath
<|endoftext|>

tea party over
lipstick 
smiles remain
<|endoftext|>

after the cloudburst
birdbath full
of sky again
<|endoftext|>

underside
of the flower pot
one hundred legs
<|endoftext|>

high tide
yesterday's footprints
gone
<|endoftext|>

coffee season
singing
from the trees
<|endoftext|>

no moisture
mother earths skin
has cracked
<|endoftext|>

typing small i
only because morning coffee
occupies my other hand...
<|endoftext|>

In the space-between
trees and mist
a white buffalo
<|endoftext|>

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

Mekong river
the swaying of our hammocks
<|endoftext|>

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

behind the cafe
the sound of children
or crows 
<|endoftext|>

rain scented air
a thousand frogs
croaking
<|endoftext|>

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt -
the garden blooms
with children's toys
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

autumn gale
a month's mortgage payments
scatter the lawn 
<|endoftext|>

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the pony's back
<|endoftext|>

november blossom 
a brightness to find
what might have been lost
<|endoftext|>

deep autumn
there's wind enough to winnow
wild rice
<|endoftext|>

shortening days...
the petals fall
into dust
<|endoftext|>

leaver's day
a wind too strong
for butterflies
<|endoftext|>

endless rain
christmas lights
bleed in a puddle
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon
the smell of woodsmoke fills
a wait for rain
<|endoftext|>

cider farm
a sweetness
on the breeze
<|endoftext|>

neon veil
a neighbour's lights
outshine the moon
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
determining the value
of new haiku
<|endoftext|>

yew harvest
deep hues fill
a redwing's hunger
<|endoftext|>

autumn gale
the sunflowers turn
their seedy cheeks
<|endoftext|>

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit
<|endoftext|>

it's what the sunflowers
waited for
<|endoftext|>

glinting on
a retirement card
autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

what I do

strewn down our lane

around a firefly

hidden by mist
<|endoftext|>

in the headlights
<|endoftext|>

dentist's chair
counting dead flies
in the striplights
<|endoftext|>

the morning after

last night's hail
<|endoftext|>

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain
<|endoftext|>

perseid showers
only rain in
the night garden
<|endoftext|>

summer longing
a dampness in the washing
left out overnight
<|endoftext|>

night after night
the farm dog forgets
he knows me of old
<|endoftext|>

my daughter breaks
the uniform code
<|endoftext|>

turn down a backroad

blackthorn blossom
follows the tracks

behaving like
a teenager again

<|endoftext|>

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
... a hair in my whiskey
<|endoftext|>

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth
<|endoftext|>

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes
<|endoftext|>

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses

of imported oranges

abandoned house 
children picking mangoes
in the yard

A pear
A worm's hole leaves
a bitter taste.

in a dark place

the beard
<|endoftext|>

emptying the wine bottle -
another conversation
about Mom
<|endoftext|>

and run
<|endoftext|>

the top button of her blouse
with my eyes

more birds than room
the smell of snow

midwinter vanished

while washing spinach
how nice to find
a haiku there

at the end
of a long learning curve
a helmut of white hair

bamboo flute
the scent
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

Ashes, what was once a man,
and the full moon.
Bright, big, yellow.
<|endoftext|>

empty room  
endless TV ads 
for nobody

almost home
the full moon between

around me
<|endoftext|>

summer's end -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying
<|endoftext|>

parking for lovers 
many crocuses between
the wheel's traces
<|endoftext|>

funeral procession
of the friend passes 
the crocus field

playing bowls,
playing at cards...
old warriors
<|endoftext|>

Independence Day
after the rainy morning
a sunny afternoon
<|endoftext|>

autumn equinox 
fox's eyes shining
in the twilight
<|endoftext|>

overturned boat,
drawn high on the shore -
drumming of rain
<|endoftext|>

meteor shower 
crickets occupied
by its song
<|endoftext|>

chilly tea-time 
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.
<|endoftext|>

watching Perseids 
a moth makes noise
on the porch
<|endoftext|>

moths fluttering
in the paper lantern?
a shadow play
<|endoftext|>

nobody's here -
only a cricket guards
the alpine hut
<|endoftext|>

long lasting rain -
the dog-rose petals clung
to the pavement
<|endoftext|>

summer's end  -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying
<|endoftext|>

summer's end .
their chirping slows down -
good-bye, cicadas!
<|endoftext|>

above the cemetery
laser beams from the disco 
a calm cricket chirp
<|endoftext|>

the rose hides
the date of death
on her grave
<|endoftext|>

sultry twilight 
pauses between bird's singing
become longer
<|endoftext|>

courtyard of my childhood 
after so many dead people
the old lilac in bloom
<|endoftext|>

afternoon tea 
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter
<|endoftext|>

under floating clouds
the cherry blossom snow 
in the same direction
<|endoftext|>

I completely forgot
the magnolia-tree,
till its bloom
<|endoftext|>

I light on again
the candle on her grave
extuinguished by wind
<|endoftext|>

first crowing
breaks my sleep 
year of Rooster
<|endoftext|>

drinking mulled wine
on the square 
white breaths
<|endoftext|>

late harvester 
sickle moon in the sky
over the mature corn
<|endoftext|>

deep in the night
my computer turned off 
sound of autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

crickets' songs
in the pitch-dark night 
how many secrets
<|endoftext|>

nobody here
a table in the mountain
speckled with petals
<|endoftext|>

 trains come and go
but the same people
drinks at bar
<|endoftext|>

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus 
<|endoftext|>

little pawprints
in the concrete
from the lost kitten
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
the low from street lamps
still lingers
your late night words
suffuse my day with warmth
<|endoftext|>

before my door
your footprints in the snow
from last night
how to absorb these echoes
of what we shared
<|endoftext|>

her father's grave -
the little girl leaves a picture
of a dinosaur
<|endoftext|>

Handel's Messiah
the same tapes my late-grandmother
listened to
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon -
the fulness
of the cow's udder
<|endoftext|>

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower
<|endoftext|>

full moon
pumpkins in the field
ready to pick
<|endoftext|>

overcast-
curls of smoke
over a shared fence
<|endoftext|>

New Year's Eve
the warmth of his eyes
over cold champagne
<|endoftext|>

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful
<|endoftext|>

solstice birthday
blowing out a candle
for each decade
<|endoftext|>

overcast day...
even the poppies
stay curled up
<|endoftext|>

early dawn...
I watch the New Year
spill down the mountain
<|endoftext|>

our greeting
between the honks
returning geese
<|endoftext|>

clouds lifting
above the archipelago
morning light
<|endoftext|>

the owl's whoo
unanswered
this autumn night
<|endoftext|>

autumn morning
spreading marmalade
over burnt toast
<|endoftext|>

autumn sun
slides through the blinds
withered sunflowers
<|endoftext|>

candlelit pumpkin
the moths reflection
in the cat's eyes
<|endoftext|>

New Year's Eve
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes
<|endoftext|>

almost Christmas 
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum
<|endoftext|>

at dusk...
the sweetness
of the roses
<|endoftext|>

winter pears
eating around
the bruises
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon
the baby stirs
in her belly
<|endoftext|>

autumn deepens
dusting off an old
bottle of port
<|endoftext|>

election results
low tide clams
spit seawater
<|endoftext|>

evening walk
acorn shells crunch
into the silence
<|endoftext|>

empty bus stop
autumn leaves swirl
in the car's wake
<|endoftext|>

flu season
to kiss
or not to kiss?
<|endoftext|>

drought-
weeds sprouting
near the sprinkler
<|endoftext|>

death watch...
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris
<|endoftext|>

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein
<|endoftext|>

at the cottage...
last year's mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall
<|endoftext|>

spring cleaning...
painting over
last year's mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>

midnight.
the stallion's single kick
against the wall
<|endoftext|>

quiet stable...
the sudden force
of horse piss
<|endoftext|>

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce
<|endoftext|>

overcast -
the next door pianist
hits a sour note
<|endoftext|>

downpour -
the pumpkin's smile
goes out
<|endoftext|>

we sip sweet tea
in silence...
a soldier's mother
<|endoftext|>

autumn visit -
over war news we talk
of babies...
<|endoftext|>

fireside -
a son's face smiles down
from the mantelpiece
<|endoftext|>

setting gibbous moon a golden jellyfish drifts under our kayak
<|endoftext|>

in the yard
between our argument -
a red dragonfly
<|endoftext|>

more rain -
mildew colors
the old roof
<|endoftext|>

half asleep -
the rhythm of the
receding rain
<|endoftext|>

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable
<|endoftext|>

night rain -
Chopin's nocturne
drowns it out 
<|endoftext|>

summer rain -
lightning whites out
the street lights
<|endoftext|>

the crow -
balancing on a wire
and now, in the wind
<|endoftext|>

midnight -
only jasmine now
and cricket song
<|endoftext|>

equinox -
the bulbul's song on the edge
between day and night
<|endoftext|>

spring evening -
a boy hums the tune I heard
half a mile ago
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
a forsythia
without birds
<|endoftext|>

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight
<|endoftext|>

unaimed day -
beneath the flipped stone
five black beetles 
<|endoftext|>

cricket song
softly, outlasting
the trucks
<|endoftext|>

red poppies...
the butterfly always just
out of reach
<|endoftext|>

night silence -
despite the dogs, despite
a crying baby
<|endoftext|>

monsoon clouds - 
a heron bathes in a pool
of light
<|endoftext|>

night rain
a bat wings its way to
tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

unhurried
the egret whiter
than the clouds
<|endoftext|>

veins of lightning
split the sky - 
smell of wet earth
<|endoftext|>

moonless
suddenly the silence
bigbangs into barking
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope
<|endoftext|>

early spring air
all day long
our beds not made
<|endoftext|>

rain on leaves tiles earth 
flute notes slither through

another insomnia night
<|endoftext|>

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day
<|endoftext|>

crowd my brain
and takes my sleep 
<|endoftext|>

and in his hair
Comptant les teintes
de gris de la mer
et de ses cheveux 
<|endoftext|>

scent of rain 
a whale-shaped cloud
hangs over the bay
<|endoftext|>

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring
<|endoftext|>

Dusting off the ancestors
and stirring up memories
Spring cleaning
<|endoftext|>

Another day of rain
her tears fall also
which is which
<|endoftext|>

waiting for the sun
the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room
<|endoftext|>

Cancer clinic visit
a bald woman passes by
with a smile
<|endoftext|>

a milky sea
mass of logs sit and rest
as an eagle soars 
<|endoftext|>

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face
<|endoftext|>

From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace
Today's lunch
<|endoftext|>

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls
<|endoftext|>

lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds 
spring dreaming
<|endoftext|>

Dawn
The night separating from the day
A bird's song
<|endoftext|>

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent
<|endoftext|>

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain
<|endoftext|>

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand
<|endoftext|>

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex

My Mother and I look
At retirement homes

On her kimono

off the pavement
<|endoftext|>

eaten one by one
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you
<|endoftext|>

A wind up frog
hops across the wooden floor
thoughts of haiku 
<|endoftext|>

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumn's abundance
<|endoftext|>

Summer's day

in my gin and tonic
<|endoftext|>

Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns
this Autumn day 
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof
<|endoftext|>

missing the sunshine
<|endoftext|>

Fall morning

<|endoftext|>

Fall afternoon

slow heart beating
<|endoftext|>

Hazy skies

this Summer day
<|endoftext|>

Crickets in the garden
time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands 
<|endoftext|>

My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away 
<|endoftext|>

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles
<|endoftext|>

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

(Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain
<|endoftext|>

conformation
the steady drip...drip...drip...drip...
of maple sap 
<|endoftext|>

between the yoga
and chi gung classes 
scent of burning sage
<|endoftext|>

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes
<|endoftext|>

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money
<|endoftext|>

After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter
<|endoftext|>

The red breasted bird
outside the cancer clinic 
Spring nest building now 
<|endoftext|>

Dark spring morning
busy conversation of birds
awakens interest
<|endoftext|>

Morning sunshine bright
chases all worry from cancer
operation success 
<|endoftext|>

Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow
<|endoftext|>

A float plane
divides the Canada geese
Summer stillness
<|endoftext|>

Summer solstice
the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill
<|endoftext|>

Spring cleaning today
dead ladybug on the window
memory of lost love
<|endoftext|>

dawn storm 
a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow
<|endoftext|>

Cold sea
and warm air merge
fog horns
<|endoftext|>

scent of seaweed
drifts into the cemetery
i walk alone
<|endoftext|>

In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops
<|endoftext|>

a slow walk
to the cemetery
memory of blue irises 
<|endoftext|>

Through the fog
a few spots of red
first Robins
<|endoftext|>

Old chestnut tree
white candles sway
Spring wind
<|endoftext|>

Ides of March
her letter to him
pain in his heart
<|endoftext|>

Lights of the ferry 
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow
<|endoftext|>

The full December moon
he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple
<|endoftext|>

The Advent wreath
candles lighting the dim room
his old eyes shinning
<|endoftext|>

horizonless 
sky-colored ice
turns in the bay
<|endoftext|>

November morning 
counting the many
shades  of grey
<|endoftext|>

Chilly morning 
mountains topped with first snow
warm coffee cup
<|endoftext|>

Snow covered temple 
lone woman in a red coat
kneels to pray anyway
<|endoftext|>

Indian Summer 
his voice in the fall
of the leaves
<|endoftext|>

Through the  pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing 
Start of a sunrise
<|endoftext|>

The rushing river 
full of the Summer's
rainfall
<|endoftext|>

The Budapest square 
Autumn leaves drift  here and there
on  young protestors
<|endoftext|>

Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg 
her shadow trailing
<|endoftext|>

Summer morning 
the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony
<|endoftext|>

This Dark and grey day 
a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses
<|endoftext|>

sharp air 
the patch of blue
changes shape
<|endoftext|>

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back
<|endoftext|>

Rain-laden cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose
<|endoftext|>

On this dark grey day
my thoughts wander to a pair
of  blue irises
<|endoftext|>

A bone scan today
on the way three birds on the
rose scented old path
<|endoftext|>

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in
<|endoftext|>

Late night jazz
the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe
<|endoftext|>

the voice of the singer
looks black
in the smoky cafe
<|endoftext|>

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top, the cat
<|endoftext|>

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound 
making my bed
<|endoftext|>

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu
<|endoftext|>

daylight moon 
the shadows of bubbles
under the ice
<|endoftext|>

Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday
<|endoftext|>

In the early morning
down on the white beach 
a turtle without eyes
<|endoftext|>

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts
<|endoftext|>

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall
<|endoftext|>

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you
<|endoftext|>

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent
<|endoftext|>

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence
<|endoftext|>

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day 
International Women's Day
<|endoftext|>

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow
<|endoftext|>

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm
<|endoftext|>

fog patches 
a second little face
in the sonogram
<|endoftext|>

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns
<|endoftext|>

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn
<|endoftext|>

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses
<|endoftext|>

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground
<|endoftext|>

Spring day
cool and grey
cup of tea
<|endoftext|>

Grey today
the waves rush
memories
<|endoftext|>

Spring morning
your hand on my breast
a bird
<|endoftext|>

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound
<|endoftext|>

Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves
<|endoftext|>

Autumn sky
shades of pink and purple

the laundromat
<|endoftext|>

First day of autumn
splash of a spawning salmon
another cycle begins
<|endoftext|>

Last day of September
bay and islands in fog
aroma of coffee
<|endoftext|>

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace
<|endoftext|>

A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses
<|endoftext|>

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow
<|endoftext|>

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air
<|endoftext|>

Over the bay
August full moon rises
as days shorten
<|endoftext|>

Reading a book
a sudden brightness
the full moon
<|endoftext|>

High winds
trees down on power lines
no morning coffee
<|endoftext|>

On a grey day
a spot of colour
his red hair
<|endoftext|>

lifting fog 
a few white feathers
in the raven's breast
<|endoftext|>

In the room
white lillies in the vase
scent of pepper
<|endoftext|>

Federal Express
reaches me through the fog
plumeria lei
<|endoftext|>

Talking with you
now this morning somehow
scent of plumeria
<|endoftext|>

Red as the poppy
maple leaves fall
on the memorial
<|endoftext|>

Light-studded ferry
passes in the starless night
another week-end
<|endoftext|>

A tunnel of fog
connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet
<|endoftext|>

October morning
a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet
<|endoftext|>

First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler
<|endoftext|>

Last night of Summer
the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud
<|endoftext|>

All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

bank thermometers 
the temperature changes
all the way home
<|endoftext|>

The sunrise
fresh salmon on ice
so very pink
<|endoftext|>

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner
<|endoftext|>

The blue iris
colour changing hue
soft Summer rain
<|endoftext|>

A sea change
the weather turns cool
hot rum and lemon
<|endoftext|>

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water
<|endoftext|>

In this desert
a memory of blue sea 
shells in the sand
<|endoftext|>

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses
<|endoftext|>

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines
<|endoftext|>

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay
<|endoftext|>

subzero 
the icicles filled
with moonlight
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues
<|endoftext|>

The curved cheek
of the young monk

in the rainforest
drip, drip, drip
<|endoftext|>

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts
<|endoftext|>

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses
<|endoftext|>

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises
<|endoftext|>

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift
<|endoftext|>

Wind howls and
the cedars sway 
drunken sailors
<|endoftext|>

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages 
haijin's notebook
<|endoftext|>

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters
<|endoftext|>

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's
eerie silence
<|endoftext|>

long cold snap 
the icicle
begins to fork
<|endoftext|>

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs
<|endoftext|>

one hundred views
of the sunrise -
appartment block
<|endoftext|>

predawn
a grey dove outside
my window
<|endoftext|>

solstice
a shaft of sunlight
through rock
<|endoftext|>

rainburst
thoughts of you
fading
<|endoftext|>

straw hat -
flowers fading
under the sun
<|endoftext|>

New sheets.
I remember
your hands.
<|endoftext|>

shaking the stone from her shoe -
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts
<|endoftext|>

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze
<|endoftext|>

soft jazz
candle light and lip gloss
in the corner 
<|endoftext|>

low clouds 
a gull circles above
the police car light
<|endoftext|>

Earth Day...
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect
<|endoftext|>

August 6
my father does not say
good morning
<|endoftext|>

cloudburst 
the last nail hammered 
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
the chalkboard screeches
at her touch 
<|endoftext|>

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk
<|endoftext|>

snow flurries :::
a blue jay's feather
clings to the yard 
<|endoftext|>

snow glare
onion bulbs sprouting 
from the bag
<|endoftext|>

geriatric ward
the table groans
when they fold it up
<|endoftext|>

sun dog
so many names
carved on the cliff 
<|endoftext|>

snowy banks 
the drifting duck leans
into a curve
<|endoftext|>

Easter
an anxious mother calls
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

breathless 
camellias falling
one by one
<|endoftext|>

starless night
Las Vegas spills
over the desert
<|endoftext|>

fragile morning
a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden
<|endoftext|>

filling with snow

and raspberry jam
<|endoftext|>

mid-summer 
the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven
<|endoftext|>

a long split
in the black inky cap 
snow clouds
<|endoftext|>

on the roof late 
my brother hammers nails
in the moon
<|endoftext|>

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling 
<|endoftext|>

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes
<|endoftext|>

the heat...
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite
<|endoftext|>

fireworks over...
the silence
of the stars
<|endoftext|>

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars
<|endoftext|>

dusk
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam
<|endoftext|>

monsoon season raindrops dot the dust
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began
<|endoftext|>

drifting from dream to dream hazy moon
<|endoftext|>

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar
<|endoftext|>

children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

her obituary...
the things we did
that summer
<|endoftext|>

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt...
my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylark's song
<|endoftext|>

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer
<|endoftext|>

season's end 
the scent of fish
drifts downstream
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes
<|endoftext|>

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems
<|endoftext|>

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve
<|endoftext|>

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall 
<|endoftext|>

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift
<|endoftext|>

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight
<|endoftext|>

as old as I feel
on a gray morning...
autumn equinox
<|endoftext|>

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight
<|endoftext|>

new coolness 
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch
<|endoftext|>

awake
in the dark
the darkness
<|endoftext|>

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly
<|endoftext|>

coming home...
the scent of the ocean
before the sound
<|endoftext|>

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers
<|endoftext|>

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope
<|endoftext|>

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku
<|endoftext|>

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be
<|endoftext|>

class reunion
an old friend's glance
at my name tag 
<|endoftext|>

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath
<|endoftext|>

just passing through...
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind
<|endoftext|>

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats
<|endoftext|>

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop
<|endoftext|>

almost spring
her pink scarf taken
by the wind
<|endoftext|>

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox
<|endoftext|>

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight
<|endoftext|>

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill
<|endoftext|>

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light
<|endoftext|>

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone
<|endoftext|>

she tells him
she's late
<|endoftext|>

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette
<|endoftext|>

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea
<|endoftext|>

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima
<|endoftext|>

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap...
this heat
<|endoftext|>

the silence
around our words...
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

the laughter of children
running uphill . . 
Gettysburg
<|endoftext|>

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter...
distant fireworks
<|endoftext|>

evening rain
she lets down
her hair
<|endoftext|>

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow
<|endoftext|>

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret
<|endoftext|>

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach
<|endoftext|>

how quickly
the nights grow longer 
fireweed in bloom
<|endoftext|>

a few petals
left by the sweeper...
sunset clouds
<|endoftext|>

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils
<|endoftext|>

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions
<|endoftext|>

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses
<|endoftext|>

a toast
to the departing year -
snow turns to rain

of a tree
<|endoftext|>

waiting room
the steady hum 
of the fish tank
<|endoftext|>

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about
<|endoftext|>

in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes
<|endoftext|>

staring out the window
at snowflakes
<|endoftext|>

of the young priest
<|endoftext|>

in her hair

just after picking it
<|endoftext|>

on the beach
by the ancient city

<|endoftext|>

rain
mixed with snow

<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat
<|endoftext|>

her head
bent over tea leaves...
how old she's grown
<|endoftext|>

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine
<|endoftext|>

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock -
the winter wind
<|endoftext|>

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love
<|endoftext|>

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen
<|endoftext|>

teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

a shorebird's call
rises from the mud
<|endoftext|>

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can

her Alzheimer's
a dragonfly
goes... comes
<|endoftext|>

last of his line
the year of his death
still uncarved

on the headstones...
just and unjust wars 
<|endoftext|>

petals in the wind
my neighbors practice tai-chi
in the parking lot

what I just said
<|endoftext|>

wrinkles in the bedsheet early dawn
<|endoftext|>

first light...
after the car alarm

something sexy
for his wife

war news
I wash the ink
from my fingers

overtime
<|endoftext|>

nearly eighty -
opening
a jar of preserves
<|endoftext|>

long after
the funeral service
- the unspoken words
<|endoftext|>

dusk-
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair
<|endoftext|>

the whistle of a distant train
going  where?
<|endoftext|>

Minnesota cold

the yellow wall
<|endoftext|>

last straw rejection

I'm too old
<|endoftext|>

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat
<|endoftext|>

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights
<|endoftext|>

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response
<|endoftext|>

A red berry falls
Staining the snow 
A silent sunset.
<|endoftext|>

This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.
<|endoftext|>

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor
<|endoftext|>

Post Office 
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms
<|endoftext|>

wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display
no buyers
<|endoftext|>

new moon 
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign
<|endoftext|>

a new month - 
different seeds 
on the spaniel's ears 
<|endoftext|>

ah these short nights
hardly time to see
seeds up
<|endoftext|>

last day of the year
a leaf in the wind over a long
stem
<|endoftext|>

a procession
the funeral of thirty one
December 2004
<|endoftext|>

snowflake
without a word, the woman
gagged
<|endoftext|>

the printer spits
Millennium phoenix
another sheet
<|endoftext|>

blue iris
she watches the needle
penetrate his flesh
<|endoftext|>

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals
<|endoftext|>

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby 
the sun on my teacup
<|endoftext|>

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain
<|endoftext|>

moss growing
on the manhole cover 
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind? 
<|endoftext|>

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer
<|endoftext|>

apple core
how to bottle
memories
<|endoftext|>

though touch-less
the intimate rustle of silk 
<|endoftext|>

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front 
<|endoftext|>

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes 
<|endoftext|>

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane
<|endoftext|>

red lobster-
her prying glance
through the mist
<|endoftext|>

news of his death 
I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon
<|endoftext|>

mixing bowls-
the shallow echoes
of bells 
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids
<|endoftext|>

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word
<|endoftext|>

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist
<|endoftext|>

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's
cough louder
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp
<|endoftext|>

pine strand
flailing in night sky-
the first low star
<|endoftext|>

twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake
somehow smaller
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline
<|endoftext|>

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones
<|endoftext|>

opaque windows 
barring the dawn 
of the new year
<|endoftext|>

even seagulls 
imitate the stones 
first frost
<|endoftext|>

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes
<|endoftext|>

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths
<|endoftext|>

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand
<|endoftext|>

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer
<|endoftext|>

crocus buds
secrets we've kept
from each other
<|endoftext|>

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight
the Milky Way
<|endoftext|>

winter sky
the white cat's eyes
bluer
<|endoftext|>

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox
<|endoftext|>

the coming of summer-
all the petals
i brushed off my hair
<|endoftext|>

gray spring dawn-
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones
<|endoftext|>

this cold-
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window
<|endoftext|>

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on-
my indecisions
<|endoftext|>

watching rain
drum beat on window pane
the deaf cat
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
shoots among the lilies
she can't name
<|endoftext|>

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes
<|endoftext|>

mirror
her mother's lips
pursing like hers
<|endoftext|>

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail
<|endoftext|>

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave
<|endoftext|>

silence -
the evening snow falls
onto moss
<|endoftext|>

secrets
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight
<|endoftext|>

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms
<|endoftext|>

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts
<|endoftext|>

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus
<|endoftext|>

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee
<|endoftext|>

deep winter
nothing much to say
even among crows
<|endoftext|>

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one
<|endoftext|>

first frost
the last of the roses
have lost their names
<|endoftext|>

girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow
lost too soon
<|endoftext|>

day after Christmas-
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits
<|endoftext|>

distant thunder-
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf
<|endoftext|>

blizzard-
the slanting lines, piercing lines
our locked hands 
<|endoftext|>

first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers
<|endoftext|>

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call
<|endoftext|>

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials 
<|endoftext|>

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle
<|endoftext|>

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain
<|endoftext|>

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku
<|endoftext|>

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars 
<|endoftext|>

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows 
<|endoftext|>

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal 
<|endoftext|>

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth
<|endoftext|>

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed
<|endoftext|>

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles
<|endoftext|>

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail
<|endoftext|>

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning
<|endoftext|>

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon
<|endoftext|>

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence
<|endoftext|>

cloudy day
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web
<|endoftext|>

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders
<|endoftext|>

stripping off
her sweatshirt 
sparks in the dark
<|endoftext|>

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow
<|endoftext|>

noon 
the morning clouds
roll from the valley
<|endoftext|>

aged painter 
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush
<|endoftext|>

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?
<|endoftext|>

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening
<|endoftext|>

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green
<|endoftext|>

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for 
supporting the Iraq war
<|endoftext|>

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot
<|endoftext|>

Cochrane Alberta 
Coyotes howling in the night 
Honking, geese at dawn 
<|endoftext|>

Like Custer's bugler,
you sound the charge. Remember
the Little Big Horn.
<|endoftext|>

I-5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars
<|endoftext|>

If you really love
America hang that flag 
on a bicycle
<|endoftext|>

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs
<|endoftext|>

slowly...
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection
<|endoftext|>

Atlanta traffic
easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down
<|endoftext|>

a hundred streets named
peachtree - no wonder sherman
burned this city down
<|endoftext|>

I saw that finger!
yes you in the Intrepid -
we shall meet again
<|endoftext|>

he's a stop and go
christopher columbus in
your ford explorer
<|endoftext|>

brooklyn bridge walkway
bombsquad found a stray backpack 
homeland traffic jam
<|endoftext|>

keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old - 
an amber alert!
<|endoftext|>

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon â€“
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden
<|endoftext|>

autumn bonfire â€“
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke
<|endoftext|>

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern
<|endoftext|>

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table
<|endoftext|>

the winter sun 
in the cancer ward -
a quiet old couple
<|endoftext|>

old pond -
another lily
in bloom
<|endoftext|>

One just sits
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.
<|endoftext|>

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise.
<|endoftext|>

chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore
<|endoftext|>

November  
her nipple ring cools
<|endoftext|>

with the typhoon  more coins
at the temple
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day 
a shadow for each
white cross
<|endoftext|>

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs
<|endoftext|>

spring moonset 
a rice ball for
breakfast
<|endoftext|>

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon
<|endoftext|>

Eating alone 
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.
<|endoftext|>

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam
<|endoftext|>

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news
<|endoftext|>

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms
<|endoftext|>

left padlocked
under streetlight
orion's bike 
<|endoftext|>

past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds
<|endoftext|>

christmas lights...
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese
<|endoftext|>

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples
<|endoftext|>

boardwalking
the dragonfly's shadow
drops through a crack
<|endoftext|>

another day
another apple crumble
... autumn deepens 
<|endoftext|>

Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have
<|endoftext|>

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples
<|endoftext|>

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks
<|endoftext|>

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars
<|endoftext|>

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot
<|endoftext|>

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener
<|endoftext|>

double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night
<|endoftext|>

i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill
<|endoftext|>

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light
<|endoftext|>

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky  some
passing clouds
<|endoftext|>

leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose
<|endoftext|>

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
rides had been
<|endoftext|>

two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river
<|endoftext|>

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars 
<|endoftext|>

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze
<|endoftext|>

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell 
<|endoftext|>

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear
<|endoftext|>

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls 
<|endoftext|>

Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen
<|endoftext|>

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swan's whiteness
<|endoftext|>

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home
<|endoftext|>

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase
<|endoftext|>

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase
<|endoftext|>

no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page
<|endoftext|>

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine
<|endoftext|>

unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles
<|endoftext|>

hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver
<|endoftext|>

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels
<|endoftext|>

faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves
<|endoftext|>

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet
<|endoftext|>

April -
a gull's cry passing
through morning snow
<|endoftext|>

rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin 
<|endoftext|>

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles
<|endoftext|>

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another
<|endoftext|>

i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over
<|endoftext|>

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane
<|endoftext|>

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed
<|endoftext|>

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death
<|endoftext|>

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run
<|endoftext|>

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard
<|endoftext|>

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn
<|endoftext|>

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train
<|endoftext|>

in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world
<|endoftext|>

somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home
<|endoftext|>

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night
<|endoftext|>

into the space between thoughts falling rose petals
<|endoftext|>

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose
<|endoftext|>

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall
<|endoftext|>

starless night
the cyclist
without lights
<|endoftext|>

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice
<|endoftext|>

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.
<|endoftext|>

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier
<|endoftext|>

muggy night opening another window to let in more insects
<|endoftext|>

sunglassesheadphones  the world beyond
<|endoftext|>

a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise
<|endoftext|>

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog
<|endoftext|>

grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence
<|endoftext|>

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e 
<|endoftext|>

sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career
<|endoftext|>

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase
<|endoftext|>

water changing
into ice 
the pale moon
<|endoftext|>

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone
<|endoftext|>

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails
<|endoftext|>

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber
<|endoftext|>

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind...
elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest
<|endoftext|>

in the grey of relentless rain 
his shaved cranium and huge red headphones
<|endoftext|>

on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here
<|endoftext|>

new moon i hear about it first via twitter
<|endoftext|>

red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened
<|endoftext|>

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

hazy afternoon
the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice
<|endoftext|>

her skin flickers in television light rain on the window
<|endoftext|>

the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile
<|endoftext|>

hard frost -
deep in my coat pocket
summer sea-glass
<|endoftext|>

that same music
again and again
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog
<|endoftext|>

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti
<|endoftext|>

still life -
at the lake's edge a tree's reflection
caught in the ice
<|endoftext|>

november sun -
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the pink tongue of a cat
lapping at snowmelt
<|endoftext|>

dusky clouds 
a patch of blue
hangs over the valley

on the ceiling- long talks
of what to do

February 
the heart-shaped tracks
of a moose
<|endoftext|>

white clouds drift
in the August sky,
a child dreams
<|endoftext|>

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide
<|endoftext|>

restless night
the morning starts
without me
<|endoftext|>

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January
<|endoftext|>

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg
<|endoftext|>

A lull in the storm 
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.
<|endoftext|>

The thyme
has gone to seed 
summer's end.
<|endoftext|>

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine
<|endoftext|>

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark 
snow, snow, snow
<|endoftext|>

cherry petals
flying higher and higher -
storm in my valley

returning birds 
three notes pass through
morning fog

and a koan to go -

on my rooftiles

from my glasses
<|endoftext|>

of snowflakes

in the shade
of the full moon...
distant fireworks
<|endoftext|>

summer heat...
the cats sleep
on the barbeque
<|endoftext|>

looking for fireflies...
I almost miss
the dramatic night sky

Windy Day
on the village walls
of leaves shadows
<|endoftext|>

the furniture only
to wait
<|endoftext|>

the house empty
It fills the sound
rain
<|endoftext|>

on the wall
in the light stripe
the shadow of a flight
<|endoftext|>

He arrives in the evening
the flight of a seagull
cuts through the silence
<|endoftext|>

laurel hedge
submerged by waste
glory in decay
<|endoftext|>

in the middle of the night
come rumors
<|endoftext|>

Roman night
stuck in a traffic jam
under the moon

party's over
by unlit candles

Just a small basketball
filled with hidden treasures
she proudly caries

falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit
<|endoftext|>

In front of bronze doors
They huddle Against the Cold

up to the shadows
<|endoftext|>

Mid morning coffee
sipped from a chipped mug old
so comforting
<|endoftext|>

Rainbows reflected
in So Many potholes

Reflects the mirror
a face I know so well
dad's

before has flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs
<|endoftext|>

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway
year egret preens
<|endoftext|>

of cold autumn rain
a dull ache
settles deep
inside my breasts
<|endoftext|>

Cracks on a sidewalk
Lost Among the grass and weeds

Where the road meets Nature's swale
memento mori
<|endoftext|>

Sentinels of spring...
kites bobbing for care
saucy winds in March

Gleaners harvest moon
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field
<|endoftext|>

glassy-eyed, gutted

at the fish market

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

the fence
<|endoftext|>

spitting seeds
into a blue Sky-
the old elm
<|endoftext|>

Forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
trucks and
<|endoftext|>

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice
<|endoftext|>

unexpected guest-
a thought out cam
of nowhere
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain

Across the field

A cold morning
the pink of tulips
through the mist.

in neon, the
scent of jasmine

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk
<|endoftext|>

winter rain

all over again
<|endoftext|>

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
how sudden this stillness then
and now how I have missed you
<|endoftext|>

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end
<|endoftext|>

lanternless night...
a whisper passing
through leaves
<|endoftext|>

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
in this circular motion
hear the laughter of children
<|endoftext|>

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
how like a fine mist that fades
this future now so fragile
<|endoftext|>

summer's end

of light
<|endoftext|>

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window
<|endoftext|>

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades
<|endoftext|>

how tenuous time now seems
slipping away
from my reach
<|endoftext|>

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air
<|endoftext|>

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know
<|endoftext|>

funeral -
stuck in an antique vase
bubble
<|endoftext|>

autumn rains
on the way to the old house
new banks
<|endoftext|>

file -
between my car stereo
two transmitters
<|endoftext|>

a slower
moon this evening...
the cold!
<|endoftext|>

the last leaf -
his white breath dissolves
in the garden
<|endoftext|>

takes the wheel
counter clockwise
<|endoftext|>

on a wall

reflection in the window
his weeping face -
thud of rain

Asked about Le Monde
glasses upside -
how tired!

out of the metro
face to face with the moon -
return from work
<|endoftext|>

full moon
above the skyscrapers -
it's midnight
<|endoftext|>

the egg seller...
her cracked hands
speak of winter
<|endoftext|>

to November
trumpets of death -
five or six
<|endoftext|>

Day of Thanksgiving -
bountiful harvest
bought cheaply
<|endoftext|>

in frosted glass
a star cluster
<|endoftext|>

finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife
<|endoftext|>

putting a cork
In last night's wine
late autumn
<|endoftext|>

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
Some counting fireflies
more than once
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers
<|endoftext|>

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot
<|endoftext|>

high noon...
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror
<|endoftext|>

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air
<|endoftext|>

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus
<|endoftext|>

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice
<|endoftext|>

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot
<|endoftext|>

my wife
home from hospital

<|endoftext|>

My 72nd winter

in every room 
<|endoftext|>

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend

<|endoftext|>

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom
<|endoftext|>

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday
<|endoftext|>

after the storm,
an egret fording
darkness
<|endoftext|>

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers
<|endoftext|>

despite my assurances
my wife's makeup
thicker
<|endoftext|>

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow
<|endoftext|>

despite the day's heat
mum's tombstone
so cold
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises
<|endoftext|>

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night
<|endoftext|>

silent
<|endoftext|>

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight 
<|endoftext|>

slowly down the hill
into darkness
<|endoftext|>

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction
<|endoftext|>

early spring...
young women collecting
peach blossoms
<|endoftext|>

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends
<|endoftext|>

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle
<|endoftext|>

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain 
<|endoftext|>

silent night
the fog thick
at every window
<|endoftext|>

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus
<|endoftext|>

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words
<|endoftext|>

while making love
the last icicle
falls

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day
<|endoftext|>

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle
<|endoftext|>

after midnight...
a shooting star beneath
the wharf
<|endoftext|>

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up
<|endoftext|>

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer
<|endoftext|>

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree
<|endoftext|>

nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds
<|endoftext|>

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend

mid-summer...
she shares with me
a ripe melon!
<|endoftext|>

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn
<|endoftext|>

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine
<|endoftext|>

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears
<|endoftext|>

death
of an old friend
my cup empty
<|endoftext|>

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues
<|endoftext|>

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness
<|endoftext|>

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog
<|endoftext|>

spring breeze
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose
<|endoftext|>

bedtime 
trying not to count
maimed solders
<|endoftext|>

in front of the brothels

<|endoftext|>

on my smartphone

ashes to ashes 
<|endoftext|>

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears

of a teen without make up
first buds
<|endoftext|>

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow 
<|endoftext|>

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star 
<|endoftext|>

more piercing
in the autumn mist

<|endoftext|>

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent
<|endoftext|>

slowly in water
<|endoftext|>

in my palm
her bigger breasts

December evening
on the ultrasound screen
as snow
<|endoftext|>

of ripe melons...
this summer moon

the shadow of her breasts
lands on me
<|endoftext|>

Back to School

Around the Moon
Slowly, the fog
above crickets

watch the moon
move behind the oak

five am
behind the thick fog
the smell of fresh bread
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
the look of love of mother
for his daughter who recites
<|endoftext|>

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds
<|endoftext|>

on the neck
the scent of her hands
drink greedily
<|endoftext|>

a pen in hand
it has its drain
and I its strengths
<|endoftext|>

like last year
cherry blossoms
hides buildings
<|endoftext|>

and smell the white lilac
hatched tonight
<|endoftext|>

of a coffee cup

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart
<|endoftext|>

contemplating
nightfall
the stone buddha
<|endoftext|>

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats
<|endoftext|>

between two rivers,
the echo of
his mallet
<|endoftext|>

sunday afternoon
a steam train
pushes back the fog
<|endoftext|>

eating rice
how many stars are
in the sky?
<|endoftext|>

falling leaves
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed
<|endoftext|>

biting his nails,
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

on my daughter's face
<|endoftext|>

swimming across
the moonlit sky
a gray carp
<|endoftext|>

half moon
darkness drinking from an
alabaster teacup

floating
down river
an egret's shadow
<|endoftext|>

dried wheat grass

first frost warning -
she no longer
pours his coffee
<|endoftext|>

burning leaves
this foggy evening
two kinds of smoke
<|endoftext|>

waiting for winter
eating rice balls
under a full moon
<|endoftext|>

scooping steamed rice,
the laborer
at sundown
<|endoftext|>

windswept afternoon
tea scent
on my tongue
<|endoftext|>

thank you, mango
for a moment i was
somewhere else
<|endoftext|>

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night
<|endoftext|>

reoccurrence
of cancer 
no spring this year
<|endoftext|>

gentle
on my window
summer rain
and his whispers rising
falling, rising...
<|endoftext|>

in memory of Quentin Crisp:
<|endoftext|>

season of mists...
a calling of wild geese
arrows south
<|endoftext|>

afternoon card parties
the rumor mill's
farm system 
<|endoftext|>

amber leaves
caught between 'for sale'
and 'sold'
<|endoftext|>

again and again -
news of his wife's death
<|endoftext|>

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo
<|endoftext|>

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha
<|endoftext|>

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter
<|endoftext|>

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again
<|endoftext|>

winter ennui... 
coming down with a slight 
touch of clouds 
<|endoftext|>

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples...
orchard fog
<|endoftext|>

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee 
<|endoftext|>

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back
<|endoftext|>

recycling
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill
<|endoftext|>

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon
<|endoftext|>

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl
<|endoftext|>

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table
<|endoftext|>

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee
<|endoftext|>

a touch 
of bluegrass...
spring 
<|endoftext|>

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain
<|endoftext|>

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow...
hot cocoa 
<|endoftext|>

cutting flowers...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space
<|endoftext|>

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book
<|endoftext|>

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep
<|endoftext|>

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift
<|endoftext|>

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide 
<|endoftext|>

another way out...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind 
<|endoftext|>

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there
<|endoftext|>

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon
<|endoftext|>

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek 
<|endoftext|>

wolf call
in the distance...
ice moon
<|endoftext|>

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below
<|endoftext|>

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone
<|endoftext|>

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to
<|endoftext|>

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts
<|endoftext|>

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

red sky-
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers
<|endoftext|>

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time
<|endoftext|>

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay
<|endoftext|>

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking
<|endoftext|>

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear
<|endoftext|>

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain
<|endoftext|>

that cricket -
it's THERE
or THERE! 
<|endoftext|>

avalanche warnings -
more tails of rain
and radiation 
<|endoftext|>

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain
<|endoftext|>

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid
<|endoftext|>

sleet ticking windows
the chemo drip
in its last hour
<|endoftext|>

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock
<|endoftext|>

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves
<|endoftext|>

midsummer morning
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor 
<|endoftext|>

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes
chilled wind
<|endoftext|>

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet
<|endoftext|>

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly
<|endoftext|>

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain
<|endoftext|>

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds
<|endoftext|>

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom
<|endoftext|>

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night
<|endoftext|>

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green
<|endoftext|>

that long-ago kiss
and still Orion strides
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

bitter cold
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food
<|endoftext|>

deepening snow
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland
<|endoftext|>

warmed-over coffee
the gray gray sound
of winter rain
<|endoftext|>

3:00 a.m.
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon
<|endoftext|>

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars
<|endoftext|>

sipping fresh cider
both dippers
among the far stars
<|endoftext|>

cool morning
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog
<|endoftext|>

meditation room
books of wisdom
lean left... and right
<|endoftext|>

turning north
sand from both oceans
in little jars
<|endoftext|>

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn
<|endoftext|>

nearly 60 
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed
<|endoftext|>

a B-52
thunders over the bay
blue heron lifting
<|endoftext|>

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses
<|endoftext|>

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac
<|endoftext|>

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms
<|endoftext|>

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light
<|endoftext|>

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag 
<|endoftext|>

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain
<|endoftext|>

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web
<|endoftext|>

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth
<|endoftext|>

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side
<|endoftext|>

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse
<|endoftext|>

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking
<|endoftext|>

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset
<|endoftext|>

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors
<|endoftext|>

falling leaves more of the sky
<|endoftext|>

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk
<|endoftext|>

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent
<|endoftext|>

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple
<|endoftext|>

open windows -
all the contrails
feathering
<|endoftext|>

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name
<|endoftext|>

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning
<|endoftext|>

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds
<|endoftext|>

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest
<|endoftext|>

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark
<|endoftext|>

Satie -
the rain
eases
<|endoftext|>

Chinese market -
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile
<|endoftext|>

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land
<|endoftext|>

strategic plan -
the sound of distant
foghorns
<|endoftext|>

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road
<|endoftext|>

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime
<|endoftext|>

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day -
recycling
old gold
<|endoftext|>

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light
<|endoftext|>

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair
<|endoftext|>

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages
<|endoftext|>

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull
<|endoftext|>

between
the Prime Minister's words
birdsong
<|endoftext|>

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky
<|endoftext|>

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose
<|endoftext|>

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface
<|endoftext|>

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous
<|endoftext|>

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist
<|endoftext|>

moon and mist 
night settles into silence
and white breath
<|endoftext|>

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash 
<|endoftext|>

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
... again and again...
<|endoftext|>

summer sunset
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows
<|endoftext|>

young girls in fog 
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco
<|endoftext|>

Chechnya 
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering
<|endoftext|>

new leaves
pattered by rain...
cardinal song
<|endoftext|>

new year...
a magpie turns over
an old leaf
<|endoftext|>

chirping birds 
the instant I press
the stop button
<|endoftext|>

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home
<|endoftext|>

examinations...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

marble moon...
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour
<|endoftext|>

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party
<|endoftext|>

sampling my husband's
home-made wine...
autumn evening
<|endoftext|>

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a far-away land
<|endoftext|>

at the window
the drumming of rain...
I catch up on sleep
<|endoftext|>

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china
<|endoftext|>

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV
<|endoftext|>

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid
<|endoftext|>

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies
<|endoftext|>

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green
<|endoftext|>

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog
<|endoftext|>

night of meteorites 
enjoying the sound of rain
instead
<|endoftext|>
