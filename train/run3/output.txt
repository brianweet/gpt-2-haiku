From birth to death

This is the story of that one day

When her name was

T.A.L - To the Living

- April 21, 2005

The day the old man died
He was warm
with his touch
the same
warm touch
and my father's voice
in the silence
his body
was like
his own
I wonder how long
our conversations
have just gone on like this

topsy-turvy
when we are no longer here ,
the sound of
horses
fostered by the sound
of rain
the long winter night
the door to the garage
is cracked
but the door
of the garage
in the morning
has its own air
her fragrance
in my heart .
"Why are you taking such a long time?"
"We're married," she replied 
in the morning,
"I wish I would've stayed ."
- the spring equinox
- May 19, 2005

to the baby's mom
"I think you are just as interested in your baby as you are in yourself."
"It isn't too late, my love."
"The old man has had his day." 
- her friend's
- June 10, 2005

the time I took a photograph
of her with her hair parted
- June 17, 2005

my wife's birthday
and me
a baby on my shoulder
- June 24, 2005

the door for the baby
is still open

the breath
of new snow
<|endoftext|>

first kiss
and then new love
<|endoftext|>

winter sunshine
pink haze over
the fallen maple

raindrops
in the palm of my hand
snow melting
<|endoftext|>

the long night
a red shawl moves
from tree to tree
<|endoftext|>

deep winter
a little snow
makes the lilt in his voice
<|endoftext|>

snowy day
tattoo'd man looks
through his sweat
<|endoftext|>

at the end of my rope
a whale floats

her last year at?
a pale light waves through
the glass door
<|endoftext|>

sounds of battle
the echo of machine gun fire
in my teacup
<|endoftext|>

in mid-air
she balances on her back
a parachute
<|endoftext|>

Christmas madness
a red poppy wavers
as it approaches
<|endoftext|>

Christmas morning
cottonwood seeds landing
in my cereal
<|endoftext|>

cracks in cement
winter rain fills
the iron net
<|endoftext|>

in a puddle
a crow at dawn
and pheasant at dusk
<|endoftext|>

prairie?
old signs pointing
to a flat earth
<|endoftext|>

cracks in the sidewalk
the child wakened by
white comellias
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
the slow circle
of a coffee cup
<|endoftext|>

in a shopping cart?
a cloud passes by
the skyline of midtown
<|endoftext|>

on the way home
slowly the shadow
creaks
<|endoftext|>

prairie setting?
an old fire ring
fills with night
<|endoftext|>

between songs
the howl of the mink
swells
<|endoftext|>

troubled by words
slowly the dawn
waves the shore
<|endoftext|>

in the distance
a creek weaves
my thoughts
<|endoftext|>

midnight moon?
the clattering of silverware
in the kitchen
