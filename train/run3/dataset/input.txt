<|endoftext|>

tall ships
the rifted sky
closes . . . opens
<|endoftext|>

in the shade
of a towering oak
acorns dropping
<|endoftext|>

a grackle not as black
as the memory of
grackles
<|endoftext|>

a river of corn lilies
divides the meadow

the
smell
of snow

already white
<|endoftext|>

summer apples dangle
up, down, side to side?
life before the fall
<|endoftext|>

dream
of a lost moon
snow light
<|endoftext|>

she checks short dress,
long hair in the window:
backhoe driver concentrates
<|endoftext|>

tails of two balloons?
all they take
with them
<|endoftext|>

city lights...
the distance
between us
<|endoftext|>

picking sea holly
the sky
just as blue

spring day...
flowers
i've never seen

old rosary
the diary
of her hands
<|endoftext|>

going the wrong way
down the street
a mockingbird
<|endoftext|>

losing track of place
on patchwork quilt
despite dropped crumbs

[insert perceptive
seventeen syllable verse
without humor here]
<|endoftext|>

a small hand
reaches for the stars
moon bounce
<|endoftext|>

valentine morning
time to release
the lovebirds
<|endoftext|>

in an old diary
between pages?
withered rose
<|endoftext|>

hospice visit
the daffodil stems
in a clear vase
<|endoftext|>

squirrel's delicate
turning of acorn
i almost kiss you
<|endoftext|>

waning moon?
on her mourning dress,
a white pacifier
<|endoftext|>

blob on the sidewalk holds her
entire small handprint
<|endoftext|>

still sky
no birds, no breeze
morning after the war
<|endoftext|>

daylilies . . .
my son's face
freckled orange
<|endoftext|>

often confused
with nine hundred count percale

towards the sky

solitaire, eats like you would
load a pellet gun
<|endoftext|>

sits in the attic
counting years
<|endoftext|>

deep shadows
i play hide and seek
with the sun
<|endoftext|>

pipe leaking
a way to get to know
new neighbors
<|endoftext|>

watching a sunset
in black and white
the color-blind man
<|endoftext|>

shyly, the lily unfolds
her petals
<|endoftext|>

she's plucking eyebrows
from the wall mirror like an
escher drawn escher
<|endoftext|>

spring breeze
smell of flowers and
starch
<|endoftext|>

this longest night?
knitting the baby's blanket
into socks
<|endoftext|>

bottoms in the air
a line
of missing ducks
<|endoftext|>

half moon?
dog's bark above
the factory noise
<|endoftext|>

what wind finds you here
begging shadows, coins tapping
songs for an alley
<|endoftext|>

growing sideways
in the deep forest?
a single birch
<|endoftext|>

skeletons of the aspen,
snowflakes dance
the winter away.
<|endoftext|>

sipping green tea
from a styrofoam cup...
stomach in knots
<|endoftext|>

the blue-eyed cat, gone
was it coyotes
or that flock of big ravens?
<|endoftext|>

freeing the ego
doesn't mean abandoning
your love of peaches
<|endoftext|>

clank of iron?
two butterflies ascend
in their mating dance
<|endoftext|>

black cars drive themselves
suits, wind flutters pages, me
buried in my clothes
<|endoftext|>

curls of smoke,
rise from my coffeepot.
the soft patter of rain.
<|endoftext|>

drifting
with the snow
a plastic bag
<|endoftext|>

a silver scimitar
new moon slices
night blue sky
<|endoftext|>

rabbits at market,
their furs pulled off like mittens?
shiny, newborn limbs.
<|endoftext|>

little windfall apples?
cartoon cherry bombs
that went pffft
<|endoftext|>

frost on morning glass
winter's gentle face, voices
whisper through windows
<|endoftext|>

on both sides
of the cemetery fence
wild flowers
<|endoftext|>

and there lies the ocean,
so grey and deep,
a bobbing yacht.
<|endoftext|>

i fill the feeder
chickadee sings
we are grateful
<|endoftext|>

the dust of two towers
is slowly obscured by smoke
from a thousand towns.
<|endoftext|>

prickly pear?
hidden in golden grass,
still green and holding
<|endoftext|>

a sunflower field
millions of tiny faces
smiling in daylight
<|endoftext|>

a soft whisper of breeze,
dandelions gently sway,
fleeting time
<|endoftext|>

small bird
on a cattail
not singing
<|endoftext|>

night walk full moon
steel rails gleam
to vanishing point
<|endoftext|>

over the hayfields,
a barn owl floats, searching.
ok, i'll listen too.
<|endoftext|>

between the trees
swoop of coloured wing and feather
and hammock song of summer
<|endoftext|>

his face
next to mine?
whiskers
<|endoftext|>

purple scented air
hovering over the lilacs
transient moment
<|endoftext|>

goodbye hug
the blue of the
forget me nots
<|endoftext|>

clay on the wheel
deep breath
reaching for the centre
<|endoftext|>

budding romance...
between them on the porch swing
a just opening rose
<|endoftext|>

an hour's walk
and getting nowhere?
the treadmill
<|endoftext|>

skin against my palm
you trace translucent road maps
read, cartographer
<|endoftext|>

he shows me his tattoo?
the tree shadow
on the sidewalk
<|endoftext|>

strong breeze
clouds sweep by
the top of the tree
<|endoftext|>

curling up
when problems arise
armadillo
<|endoftext|>

spring recital?
mozart on the piano keys
bird warbles at the window
<|endoftext|>

left in the closet
an umbrella, forgotten
rain cloud emptying
<|endoftext|>

the sweat dripping drip-
ping into your eyes like tears
for all my efforts
<|endoftext|>

sleeping in?
his side of the bed
still warm
<|endoftext|>

roots of the dead spruce
reach out bony fingers
secret life exposed
<|endoftext|>

spring break
crocus pokes its head
through the melting of march
<|endoftext|>

radiant heater
a cat by the window
purrs
<|endoftext|>

echoes of sunset
your upturned face a canvas?
splashed watercolor
<|endoftext|>

exchange
of wedding vows?
the incoming tide
<|endoftext|>

from tree-shadow to
lighted pools, startled koi: paint-
brush lines on water.
<|endoftext|>

we will miss you -
farewell, mr. vonnegut.
i laughed; wept
<|endoftext|>

bowl of tomatoes
first hint of ripening
early dawn glow
<|endoftext|>

glasses on table -
grandpa passed in june,
only two months away
<|endoftext|>

smile amphibian
servile fly crowning frog prince
order among thieves
<|endoftext|>

plane ticket to france
like a "fuck thou" ode to you
if i had the balls
<|endoftext|>

coarse white pubic hair
sign of fleeting time old age
now at the ready
<|endoftext|>

bursts over belt loops
designer brand across her ass
"guess" what?... your weight?
<|endoftext|>

to touch, be touched
is everything worth wanting
yes, there and yes, that
<|endoftext|>

mountains, but not stone?
white sculptures too pure for hands.
i break like a wave.
<|endoftext|>

a photo is all
we have of our rendezvous
between here and there.
<|endoftext|>

snow on the ground
streetlamps are on
at four o'clock
<|endoftext|>

still, white cityscape
belies fury of last night's
edmonton blizzard
<|endoftext|>

luminescent lures
draw them close to its dark mouth
the nightclub swallows
<|endoftext|>

lightning eyes flashing
and your face darkens and clouds
thunder comes after
<|endoftext|>

quick steps on hard wood,
a racing heart / shadow hips,
scream of passing skin.
<|endoftext|>

winter is a birth
of lofty expectations
for the next season.
<|endoftext|>

elton john sings
a texas love song as
first snow falls
<|endoftext|>

time flows freely, like
water in a river, no
dam can hold it back
<|endoftext|>

dusk rain surrenders
bright clouds bleed a war-red
kurosawa sky
<|endoftext|>

graying sky soaring;
a roof above the heads of
mortal creatures beneath
<|endoftext|>

in the hour of foxes
shadows slip and slink around
edges of perception
<|endoftext|>

flesh gnaws at its chains.
tainted souls dance in rubble /
echoes murmur in the skin.
<|endoftext|>

familiar photos on the wall
remind me of who i am
but who the fuck are they?
<|endoftext|>

iridescence
painting colour in the moist air
clouds weeping prisms
<|endoftext|>

fall's blaze of folly
deposits rich red blood cells
on winter's bare bones
<|endoftext|>

freshly shaved legs
and washed my sheets today
going to bed bliss
<|endoftext|>

the smell of wet earth
streetlight halos in the rain;
yukatta raincoat
<|endoftext|>

no washrooms anywhere;
crouching behind a tree
i can hear everything now
<|endoftext|>

drowning in whiskey -
she left again
and keeps leaving
<|endoftext|>

burned trees among
the fading living:
reminder
<|endoftext|>

coffee with buddha
i talk about my worries
his dick-ass smile.
<|endoftext|>

broken umbrellas
young women's hats-flattened
cormorant weather
<|endoftext|>

corner store:
spider's built a web
across the butterfly nets
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon?
still, i turn my gaze back
to the muddied path
<|endoftext|>

good night, fair city
your belly button sex drive
makes me fucking sick
<|endoftext|>

trying to tune in
a song of the soul but my
reception is bad
<|endoftext|>

not willing to leave
this imperfect nest, this bird
has so much to learn.
<|endoftext|>

water into wine
every time you look at me
my girl parts get drunk
<|endoftext|>

starlings gossip
amused at our lovemaking
the quivering limbs
<|endoftext|>

winter chill-
around the windy corner,
surprise! full moon.
<|endoftext|>

midnight:
bats are diving
"it's hot," she says
<|endoftext|>

whiskey and cigars
perfect companions for this
mountainous refuge
<|endoftext|>

spring football players
pop and hustle, grunting.
yearless. fatter.
<|endoftext|>

alone tonight-
how blue
the moonlit iris
<|endoftext|>

the clouds open up
a halo of rain, downpour
your lips, glistening
<|endoftext|>

luggage gone astray
'welcome home' from purring cat
the best elixir
<|endoftext|>

curvaceous woman
vibrates at the edge of you
a dark, sultry lie
<|endoftext|>

bedded now, and filled with tar
counting his regrets
<|endoftext|>

he begins by contemplating
the blonde's navel

over the river
<|endoftext|>

the rainbow
arrives there before me
<|endoftext|>

changing our sheets -
cherry blossom
drifts to the floor
<|endoftext|>

camping ground -
the cries
of other people's children
<|endoftext|>

leaving your home -
kowhai flowers
flick off my windscreen
<|endoftext|>

round and
round and round -
the moon
<|endoftext|>

lamplight -
a moth zigzags
between stars
<|endoftext|>

benefit cuts
her letter to santa
goes unanswered
<|endoftext|>

spring moon
she re-threads my dead
nana's pearls
<|endoftext|>

where soldiers
once slept and died -

<|endoftext|>

replying to his letter
the paper cold
against my hand
<|endoftext|>

a ponga frond
unwinding
<|endoftext|>

old pines
each one leans
apart
<|endoftext|>

walking over pebbles
her pocket
grows heavy
<|endoftext|>

a dog sniffs the base
of the goal-post
<|endoftext|>

on a diet
she devours
recipe books

through the mist

hangs in the air
<|endoftext|>

fills the spaces
<|endoftext|>

so close
<|endoftext|>

last sun
the footprints over the dunes
filled with shadow
<|endoftext|>

morning shallows
the wading birds
all conjoint
<|endoftext|>

low tide -
i walk to you
across the sky
<|endoftext|>

all this way
in your letter
that cigarette smell
<|endoftext|>

checking the map
the road disappears
into a fold
<|endoftext|>

weather forecast
searching the sky
for an isobar
<|endoftext|>

clearing the misty window
to see the mist

of blood

gravestone
underneath the weeds
we will not forget
<|endoftext|>

in the dark part
of her wardrobe -
a snout, eyes
<|endoftext|>

summer rain -
finding chocolate frogs
at the back of the shop
<|endoftext|>

each streetlight
with its own rain -

of her black pearls
<|endoftext|>

the moon
in her hair
<|endoftext|>

waitangi -

sings a different song
<|endoftext|>

family photo box
how my father smiles
in black and white
<|endoftext|>

raindrops
and the sound
of a shoe being unlaced
<|endoftext|>

bitter tea - my teeth
leave indentations
in the polystyrene cup
<|endoftext|>

to write as simply
as you pick
a single blade of grass
<|endoftext|>

each day less light,
the smell of printer's ink
on the morning newspaper
<|endoftext|>

first snow,
the eyes of the sparrows
sharp and bright
<|endoftext|>

during the rainstorm
the child's colouring-in
becomes more intense
<|endoftext|>

winter's end-
a folded poem
stops the window rattling
<|endoftext|>

the storm passes,
sunlight
on the back of a sheep
<|endoftext|>

red red hibiscus,
its stamen casts
a purple shadow
<|endoftext|>

sweeps away
bits of itself

landing in her lap
a scroll of bark
from the eucalypt
<|endoftext|>

losing track
of my thoughts the flight
of a butterfly
<|endoftext|>

my mouth
full of fingers, the dentist
asks about holidays
<|endoftext|>

sunny day
butter melting
on sweet corn cobs
<|endoftext|>

bringing
this sky inside
breath
<|endoftext|>

heat of the night
the folded stillness
of a rescued moth
<|endoftext|>

pear blossom
where the old white horse
used to stand
<|endoftext|>

approaching summer
the paths of the cattle
through the dew
<|endoftext|>

new moon and star
just the slightest curve
of her belly
<|endoftext|>

surf mist
the salt of a grief
without tears
<|endoftext|>

frolicking
in the disused cow pond
two dragonflies
<|endoftext|>

end of summer term
students' duties removed
from the whiteboard
<|endoftext|>

on the battlefield

chinese busker -
the notes of his bone flute
carried on the wind
<|endoftext|>

into the hills
<|endoftext|>

under my hand
slow sweep
of a horse's mane
<|endoftext|>

on blocks
<|endoftext|>

gloomy day
the farmer's motorbike light
on the flooded field
<|endoftext|>

summer dawn
the runners' footsteps
past the window
<|endoftext|>

above ancient
fortifications
transmitting antenna
<|endoftext|>

after your
telephone call
the rain
<|endoftext|>

just the retriever's
nose above the stick -
flight of wading birds
<|endoftext|>

wrecked ship
beside the memorial
a starfish
<|endoftext|>

midnight thirst
drinking from cupped hands
- a moth's closed wings
<|endoftext|>

in her bedroom
all her lovers
only photographs
<|endoftext|>

on the front lawn
trying to fly his kite -
the wind won't
<|endoftext|>

tartan umbrella
my own bright roof
in the alleyway
<|endoftext|>

hurting me more
the departure
of my son's lover
<|endoftext|>

sheltering also
this sandfly
on my hand
<|endoftext|>

southerly storm
we give the old ewe a hand
with her last triplet
<|endoftext|>

impaled on ranks
of friendly eyes
<|endoftext|>

strewn on the road

and a teddy bear

arrive to help
<|endoftext|>

moon eclipse
meeting our shy neighbour
for the first time
<|endoftext|>

tea with mother-in-law? -
condescension
clouding the view
<|endoftext|>

washing
my mother's breasts
we both giggle
<|endoftext|>

climbing motuara -
a saddleback darts
under my breath
<|endoftext|>

after the storm
the garden flooded
with light
<|endoftext|>

family christmas -
sharpening
all the knives
<|endoftext|>

the fields of flanders?-
the rich red
of the cemetery gates

in the garden

how to dress her
for eternity

below the horizon

this lambent light
over autumn fields
southbound geese
<|endoftext|>

morning glories,
butterflies,
were they not right here?

returns to the sea

and the spider lily

of house timbers
<|endoftext|>

clatter of pipes
when i turn the tap off

a hawk's cry
i listen
to the gathering dark
<|endoftext|>

how strange this human body

to say he's feeling better
<|endoftext|>

casts shadows on the wall

the longest day
he stills the mower
at twilight

tilting a longneck
all the way up
<|endoftext|>

pulses
<|endoftext|>

haggling over price

from somewhere close
the fragrance of lilies
<|endoftext|>

at the centre
of constant ripples
a moorhen's nod
<|endoftext|>

early spring
the young boys spinning
till they?re dizzy
<|endoftext|>

graveside
my breasts
leaking
<|endoftext|>

waxing moon
the sound of a butterfly
emerging
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
her finger shushes
my lips
<|endoftext|>

mile high . . .
adding my breath
to the clouds
<|endoftext|>

what do i know
about the untethered balloon
my daughter's embrace
<|endoftext|>

his ashes
turning into the current
the turtle's ears
<|endoftext|>

early morning
glue sets in the shade
of the old shed
<|endoftext|>

early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks
<|endoftext|>

that dull gleam
through the hazy park
a playhouse window
<|endoftext|>

one maple leaf . . .
end over end on the sand
without a trace
<|endoftext|>

everywhere this morning
maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain
<|endoftext|>

summer dawn
light around the windows
as at grandmother's
<|endoftext|>

thump and screech
the long freight pulls out
in robin's song
<|endoftext|>

restless pigeons
gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
would i look at the clouds
without it?
<|endoftext|>

how to tell
of the myriad rich browns?
pin-oak leaves
<|endoftext|>

persons and place
to view the moon
sake not quite full
<|endoftext|>

santoka too
passed away on this date
wine with my tears
<|endoftext|>

long road
the leaves and i
windblown
<|endoftext|>

sunshine
the colours
of the hill
<|endoftext|>

temple steps
his shoes
in the autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

backyard pine
what can i do
with all these crows
<|endoftext|>

his lantern's glow
pushing back the dark
frog song
<|endoftext|>

ebb tide
the heron steps
into twilight
<|endoftext|>

daybreak . . .
a migratory bird's feather
on the path
<|endoftext|>

love:
a kigo for all
seasons
<|endoftext|>

a memorial bell
tolls tolls and stops,
but his words . . .
<|endoftext|>

blue dragonfly
pine needles cover
the narrow path
<|endoftext|>

the mountain pine
holding the light,
held by it
<|endoftext|>

?bill's day?
draw the letters
in aspen-glow
<|endoftext|>

a little cold
and without the bright fish
this golden pond
<|endoftext|>

gray october
the poet's voice
outlives him
<|endoftext|>

full moon
and so my thoughts
turn to you
<|endoftext|>

vest pocket park
the leaves a little
less brilliant
<|endoftext|>

at his passing
a ripple in the river
of stars
<|endoftext|>

misty shroud
leaves falling
between the rails
<|endoftext|>

sunset fades
from the highest peak
autumn chill
<|endoftext|>

higginson's haiku
still among the living;
the autumn wind
<|endoftext|>

a teacher's passing . . .
moonlight bathes
the apple tree
<|endoftext|>

another light
now
among the stars
<|endoftext|>

a gentle breeze ripples
everywhere his words
leaves on grass
<|endoftext|>

opening his book . . .
the world he offered
tumbles out
<|endoftext|>

beyond emptiness
the moon filling itself
for certain
<|endoftext|>

autumn evening . . .
adding another star
to the milky way
<|endoftext|>

prayer flags
the autumn leaves carry
the blessings to you
<|endoftext|>

cloudy day
the janitor misses
a fallen leaf
<|endoftext|>

surf murmurs
the basso continuo
behind the dunes
<|endoftext|>

this fragility
white cranes laced
in the air
<|endoftext|>

dry autumn
the fading vibrance
of a spider lily
<|endoftext|>

hard to tell you
how i feel . . .
this late autumn sky
<|endoftext|>

petrified forest
a stone axe echoes
in the sky
<|endoftext|>

autumn ginko
one by one
into mist
<|endoftext|>

harvest home
a red nasturtium
heads for the stars
<|endoftext|>

a single breath
the ember
comes to life
<|endoftext|>

leaving us in autumn . . .
leaving behind him
the blossoms to come
<|endoftext|>

ebbing tide
a bright shell caught
by the current
<|endoftext|>

tree leaves fall
as the long journey begins
a fading hymn
<|endoftext|>

white hydrangea
fading
in white light
<|endoftext|>

insect chirps
lingering low on the ground
the later moon
<|endoftext|>

heavy fog
the mountain still back there
out of sight
<|endoftext|>

what a silence!
and nobody's around
to share it with
<|endoftext|>

migrating birds
i hear his voice in the wind
toward nirvanna
<|endoftext|>

bleu roi
a thousand flying foxes
quarter moon
<|endoftext|>

walking alone
the filtered sounds
of the hototogisu
<|endoftext|>

dusk
a half-ripe melon
frees itself from the vine
<|endoftext|>

patter of raindrops
in autumn leaves . . .
the seasons turn
<|endoftext|>

his passing . . .
the small fir collects
fallen leaves
<|endoftext|>

starry night . . .
a worn phone number
in the handbook
<|endoftext|>

morning frost
a monk's chant
crosses the river
<|endoftext|>

stalagmites
a passel of school children
up ahead
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves . . .
in the book she gave me
an old library stamp
<|endoftext|>

autumn gust
the starlings? wings
tilt in unison
<|endoftext|>

withered juniper
mother's hair
since the nursing home
<|endoftext|>

village temple
kids behind the gods
playing hide and seek
<|endoftext|>

through endless rain
the whistle
of the paperboy
<|endoftext|>

the taste of cider
when fallen leaves begin
to overlap
<|endoftext|>

bustling shoppers
the bell ringer's
prosthetic hand
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice . . .
smoothing a folded corner
in my library book
<|endoftext|>

a single bubble
after the beaver dives
the rising moon
<|endoftext|>

the gardener
and his scarecrow
the same hat
<|endoftext|>

crows swagger
down the middle of the road
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

starting school tomorrow
he talks to trees
at the woods? edge
<|endoftext|>

labor day
a spot of barbecue sauce
on the face of my watch
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
two flies fighting
over me
<|endoftext|>

the ease
of summer's last days
<|endoftext|>

a still, starry night

wet with dew
<|endoftext|>

the snake as long
as my sleeve
<|endoftext|>

in none of the field guides
<|endoftext|>

of the gentian
<|endoftext|>

through the mangroves

of the sea
<|endoftext|>

the outstretched fingers
of a toddler
first winter rain
<|endoftext|>

vernal equinox
storks again
in the old nest
<|endoftext|>

circle of lamplight
i complete the baby quilt
begun for me
<|endoftext|>

between windows
the space the spider
lived and died
<|endoftext|>

another soldier . . .
the sound of wind
through a hole in the fence
<|endoftext|>

i raise my head
from his chest, heartbeats
to crickets
<|endoftext|>

first yoga session:
rhythmic
creaking
<|endoftext|>

husband spellbound
his wife's version
of their courtship
<|endoftext|>

bird house empty of seed
even the jays
look for bernard
<|endoftext|>

hospital vigil
the imperceptible shift
of clouds
<|endoftext|>

deserted beach
missing a child's
hand to hold
<|endoftext|>

clutches its chest
<|endoftext|>

from her notebook
<|endoftext|>

i know

in the poet's circle
words of love
<|endoftext|>

blue september sky

we want to know
<|endoftext|>

death of a friend
loss of her creative soul
inflames, inspires mine
<|endoftext|>

her yellow painting
above bifocals, her dark eyes
even brighter
<|endoftext|>

no matter how short we may fall . . .
my image of you
shall always stand tall
<|endoftext|>

sometimes i think . . .
you would answer the phone
if i were to call
<|endoftext|>

warm earth
the gardens
it makes
<|endoftext|>

moonless night
in the harvested wheat field
i, too, am empty
<|endoftext|>

the quiet strengths
of a gentle leader
colors that will not fade
<|endoftext|>

exchanging haiku stories
we forget we live
on different continents
<|endoftext|>

one breath
the distance between
i am and i was
<|endoftext|>

rereading the renga
we wrote a decade ago . . .
my name: her name
<|endoftext|>

windstorm
the garden stripped of
her bright colors
<|endoftext|>

there is no ending
only the change
of seasons
<|endoftext|>

twilight lingers
the thousand echoes
of her wordless things
<|endoftext|>

against his lips

fresh tar
black-eyed susans
lost in the scent
<|endoftext|>

menfolk
a pup in the middle
of idle pats and'scratches
<|endoftext|>

thinning the carrots . . .
still thinking about the child
miscarried

travels down the fence

sparrows pick the insects
from a semi's grill
<|endoftext|>

of her sewing machine

have memory?
<|endoftext|>

remembering him

still pink inside
<|endoftext|>

moonlight
on the rocky side
of an oyster shell
<|endoftext|>

reaches the pond's edge

ready for planting

at my parents? grave

of a hotdog stand
<|endoftext|>

at pinball

of smoke

closing the car window
on my hair

black-out--
the holiday glow
of fireflies
<|endoftext|>

black-out--
in my neighbor's house
a room to room glow
<|endoftext|>

of winter rain

crawling away

just before the rain

I study the moss
in a park bench

I'm too old

crayoned on the wall

fills the air

over the desert

and eagle picks over
what the tide left
<|endoftext|>

ebb tide --
a photo of a missing girl
flutters in the breeze
<|endoftext|>

frog bones in
the middle of the path
<|endoftext|>

after the long wait . . .
  two unattended dove eggs
      in summer rain
<|endoftext|>

walking to work -
the blossoms on my street
late this year
<|endoftext|>

asleep on the dock
<|endoftext|>

he remembers
to lift the sea
<|endoftext|>

Falling leaves
I already miss you
This winter

warms my nose

a dragged Christmas tree
<|endoftext|>

fireworks gone
Orion's beauty remains
in the stillness
<|endoftext|>

Mass over--

out of the lot
<|endoftext|>

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light -
even fresh flowers, fade
<|endoftext|>

home again
even the ants
seem familiar
<|endoftext|>

along the road
shape of a willow
conforms to the trucks
<|endoftext|>

obituary

smiles from the page

the magnolia-tree,
till its bloom
<|endoftext|>

I light on again
the candle on her grave
extuinguished by wind
<|endoftext|>

under floating clouds
the cherry blossom snow --
in the same direction
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day --
awakened by a kiss
from the dog
<|endoftext|>

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

In the space-between
trees and mist
a white buffalo
<|endoftext|>

a famished mallard
has emigrated
to the city zoo
<|endoftext|>

an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese
<|endoftext|>

her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging
<|endoftext|>

Saturday night
the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall
<|endoftext|>

warm rain on the pond
my thoughts rise
with the koi
<|endoftext|>

to the headstone
old footsteps frozen
in old snow
<|endoftext|>

pissing in a puddle
droplets of moonlight
on her sandal
<|endoftext|>

mango flavoured tea
in a silver tin - departing guests
linger a while
<|endoftext|>

cold snap-
her pause before
each tulip
<|endoftext|>

Coltrane
two floors up...floats
out a window
<|endoftext|>

her hair
brushed with moonlight...
forty years ago
<|endoftext|>

flat moon ...
an aspirine tablet and a
glass of water
<|endoftext|>

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog
<|endoftext|>

bitter cold--
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food
<|endoftext|>

that long-ago kiss--
and still Orion strides
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

drunk tonight---
an elixir of cherry blossoms
and moonlight
<|endoftext|>

eyeing
the apple
at buddha's feet
<|endoftext|>

the farmer,
planting corn under
a pregnant moon
<|endoftext|>

a fly beats
against the window --
melting snow
<|endoftext|>

a soda can
shot full of holes --
spring sun
<|endoftext|>

Easter morning --
I head out into
trackless snow
<|endoftext|>

first pussy willows --
the sound of a woodpecker
shifts again
<|endoftext|>

home sick --
just the sound
of icicles dripping
<|endoftext|>

spring frost --
a tower light pierces
the sunset
<|endoftext|>

spring in the air --
my walking stick pierces
crusted snow
<|endoftext|>

subzero --
a moth flies towards
the moonlit door
<|endoftext|>

dachau
a blue sky above
the chimneys
<|endoftext|>

morning frost
she leaves
first
<|endoftext|>

evening walk
smell of tar between
pines
<|endoftext|>

on CNN
if you listen carefully
you can hear
<|endoftext|>

december
a long shadow
joins another
<|endoftext|>

end of path
snowflakes melting
on the pond
<|endoftext|>

late winter -
opening the saijiki
to early spring
<|endoftext|>

drunk on the beach-
the moon in my sake cup
disappears
<|endoftext|>

after its first flight
the young gerfalcon's talons
tighter on my glove
<|endoftext|>

chill wind
beneath the monk's robe
a naked monk
<|endoftext|>

sudden gust
carp leap from poles
to gulp the air
<|endoftext|>

moonless night
a cereus cactus opens
solstice blooms
<|endoftext|>

ex-girlfriend
with a baby carriage
spring rain
<|endoftext|>

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog
<|endoftext|>

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong
<|endoftext|>

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues
<|endoftext|>

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn
<|endoftext|>

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine
<|endoftext|>

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness
<|endoftext|>

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears
<|endoftext|>

death
of an old friend
my cup empty
<|endoftext|>

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife
<|endoftext|>

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit slower
<|endoftext|>

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk
<|endoftext|>

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again
<|endoftext|>

no island
in the bay today
morning fog
<|endoftext|>

stop sign
thru the bullet holes
ghetto moon
<|endoftext|>

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee
<|endoftext|>

Central Park
the echo of her voice
in every direction 
<|endoftext|>

sunny day
a wasp tastes
everyone's beer
<|endoftext|>

dusk--
the mason jar filled
with fireflies
<|endoftext|>

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus 
<|endoftext|>

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful
<|endoftext|>

afternoon tea --
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter
<|endoftext|>

chilly tea-time --
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.
<|endoftext|>

almost home
the full moon between
two houses
<|endoftext|>

roadside rest stop
he adds a haiku
to the graffiti
<|endoftext|>

dull pencil
the staff meeting goes
on and on
<|endoftext|>

senior's home
we celebrate the new year
a 7:00 pm
<|endoftext|>

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections
<|endoftext|>

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish
<|endoftext|>

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line
<|endoftext|>

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road
<|endoftext|>

long journey back home --
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away
<|endoftext|>

afternoon escape
within the prison walls
a library
<|endoftext|>

strong April wind
the smell of Iowa hogs
in Minnesota
<|endoftext|>

homework --
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds
<|endoftext|>

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

her famous blue haiku
about her divorce
and his cactus
<|endoftext|>

fading light -
the stone steps brighter
than the foliage
<|endoftext|>

storm clouds -
mother searches for
candles
<|endoftext|>

lavender blooms
next to the violets
in a blue pot
<|endoftext|>

after a cold night
a cup of coffee -
oh, man!
<|endoftext|>

Xmas away from home -
B-52 pilot
dressed as Santa
<|endoftext|>

hedgehog in the fog
looking for apples
under the wrong tree
<|endoftext|>

van gogh's blue irises
hangs on a wall, with
other gardens
<|endoftext|>

restless night
the morning starts
without me
<|endoftext|>

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon
<|endoftext|>

old pond -
another lily
in bloom
<|endoftext|>

storm clouds -
the roofer talks about
overtime
<|endoftext|>

nearly eighty -
opening
a jar of preserves
<|endoftext|>

a dark horse
with a blue harness --.
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

spring wind --
the magnolia sweeps
the sky
<|endoftext|>

night shift --
he tree frogs sing a road
through the forest
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay
<|endoftext|>

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses
<|endoftext|>

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses
<|endoftext|>

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines
<|endoftext|>

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September
<|endoftext|>

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues
<|endoftext|>

rainy day
in the rainforest
drip, drip, drip
<|endoftext|>

The curved cheek
of the young monk
sunlight on the bay
<|endoftext|>

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts
<|endoftext|>

lost in her mind
fields of white daisies
and summer
<|endoftext|>

mason jar
full of dead fireflies
dark night
<|endoftext|>

half-dark sky
a slow roll of thunder
joins the cicada
<|endoftext|>

wave-sound
the smooth stone
fits my hand
<|endoftext|>

lost friendship
a stray wisp of fog clings
to the canyon
<|endoftext|>

hot night
the moon nearly full
the mosquitoes too
<|endoftext|>

funeral procession
a bee lands
on the flowers
<|endoftext|>

Gandhi's birthday
constantly relighting candles
during the peace March
<|endoftext|>

morning radio news
a snail crawls up the front wheel
of the express bus
<|endoftext|>

hilltop
the clouds
rising to my feet
<|endoftext|>

morning chill
a spider's web gleams
on the barbed wire
<|endoftext|>

along the pavement
snatches of the same song
from different radios
<|endoftext|>

monotonous rain
frogs singing
in many voices
<|endoftext|>

clear night
a fireworks flower
opens against the full moon
<|endoftext|>

monsoon clouds
a solitary
bright red kite
<|endoftext|>

rain clouds
a kingfisher watches
the busy traffic
<|endoftext|>

sultry afternoon
iridiscent fly gleams green
or maybe blue
<|endoftext|>

dry stream bed
clouds drift
above the train
<|endoftext|>

windy
a floating leaf
turns butterfly
<|endoftext|>

cloudburst
two men in the doorway
chat about war
<|endoftext|>

her father's grave -
the little girl leaves a picture
of a dinosaur
<|endoftext|>

Handel's Messiah
the same tapes my late-grandmother
listened to
<|endoftext|>

my son's twelfth birthday
a rabbit hops
across the busy street
<|endoftext|>

distant thunder --
a shower of pollen
falls from the trees
<|endoftext|>

sunny spring day
walking through a cloud
of perfume
<|endoftext|>

staring at me
from the bathroom mirror
an age spot
<|endoftext|>

the end of summer --
my light beer
suddenly darker
<|endoftext|>

Autumn colors --
the receptionist's
bright red hair
<|endoftext|>

Ash Wednesday --
the priest
lights a cigarette
<|endoftext|>

between
silent construction cranes
the Milky Way
<|endoftext|>

first frost --
I trim
my graying beard
<|endoftext|>

three shades too dark
the lipstick
on his collar
<|endoftext|>

my daughter starts college --
another empty
pint of beer
<|endoftext|>

first day of vacation --
shooting star
on a moonless night
<|endoftext|>

a familar name
on the victims list --
my coffee grows cold
<|endoftext|>

where dirty snow
meets road salt
a dozen roses
<|endoftext|>

afghan invasion --
the dog
on my side of the bed
<|endoftext|>

Spring snow --
an expecting mother rests
her hands on her belly
<|endoftext|>

the train arrives
one more sip
from an empty cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

approaching storm --
my twelve year-old's fascination
with war
<|endoftext|>

energy crisis --
long line
at the coffee shop
<|endoftext|>

snow mixes with rain --
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother's name
<|endoftext|>

the haze lifts --
she tosses her hair
over her shoulder
<|endoftext|>

my daughter's graduation
tightening the knot
on my necktie
<|endoftext|>

away on business --
the restless cat
on your side of the bed
<|endoftext|>

train running late
an ant climbs
the station wall
<|endoftext|>

dangerous lightning --
she watches me
watching her
<|endoftext|>

crowded train station --
the tap tap thump
of a blind man's cane
<|endoftext|>

planning our trip
lightning flashes
beyond the horizon
<|endoftext|>

wedding night
the parents of the bride
in separate beds
<|endoftext|>

unhooking her bra
the moon peeks
over the treetops
<|endoftext|>

snow outside
a small bowl
of imported oranges
<|endoftext|>

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes
<|endoftext|>

a temple garden
snowy path to bronze bell
having deep footprints
<|endoftext|>

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses
<|endoftext|>

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
... a hair in my whiskey
<|endoftext|>

wiping the full moon
from a wet glossy table
with my bare hand
<|endoftext|>

her garden bench
she was always sitting----
butterfly on moss
<|endoftext|>

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth
<|endoftext|>

stillness . . .
a few flat stones
beneath the pine
<|endoftext|>

purple irises
stand still
rain or shine
<|endoftext|>

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation
<|endoftext|>

crisp morning air
a bird left his feather
at my window
<|endoftext|>

muggy night
a lizard on the window screen
- motionless
<|endoftext|>

scent of lilies
orange pollen
on my white sweater
<|endoftext|>

summer night breeze
each wish
on bamboo branches
<|endoftext|>

rain clouds
fragrance of
sweet basil
<|endoftext|>

moonless night -
the bell buoy
talks to itself
<|endoftext|>

never in darkness
ground zero lights the night
New Year's Eve
<|endoftext|>

morning tea
he cups his hands
around the glass
<|endoftext|>

thrill of her flute -
twenty three years
of our lips touching
<|endoftext|>

summer haze-
a lone grey wolf pads south
along the highway
<|endoftext|>

stilled by the stream -
delicate frost flowers
crunch under work boots
<|endoftext|>

after the guests leave
the lilies
open
<|endoftext|>

Lighting the room,
candle by candle;
a winter evening.
<|endoftext|>

the mulberry--
one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work
<|endoftext|>

divorce hearing
we talk about
the rain
<|endoftext|>

daybreak
the train graffiti drips
autumn dew
<|endoftext|>

stroke of midnight
the blast of foghorns
along the coast
<|endoftext|>

after the rain
I check the growth
of each tulip
<|endoftext|>

the night train passes
along the mountain trail
garlic snores
<|endoftext|>

the rain
almost a friend
this funeral
<|endoftext|>

carousel rider
the pole still warm
from her touch
<|endoftext|>

gray drizzle
for miles and miles
this road I'm on
<|endoftext|>

old cottonfields
a long time
between snows
<|endoftext|>

harmonica player
he cups the cold
in his hands
<|endoftext|>

our anniversary
so many candle flames
in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

early summer
the ice cream truck
makes another round
<|endoftext|>

ring around the moon
I remember parts
of a nursery rhyme
<|endoftext|>

new gravesite
the persistent taps
of a woodpecker
<|endoftext|>

empty bleachers
a late night fog
takes the field
<|endoftext|>

butterfly on the windshield
another journey
incomplete
<|endoftext|>

emergency broadcast
we head for the storm cellar
with a bottle of wine
<|endoftext|>

late spring
each clock in the house
shows a different time
<|endoftext|>

leaving home
the warmth still inside
my freshly ironed shirt
<|endoftext|>

dead leaves and rust
a few things remain
in the fallout shelter
<|endoftext|>

liberty market
one free pickle
from the barrel
<|endoftext|>

evening walk
same flickering glow
house to house
<|endoftext|>

Museum of Transport
train, tracks and gravel
the morning sun warms up
<|endoftext|>

between Lake Erie
and the nuclear station
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn
<|endoftext|>

nearly 60 --
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed
<|endoftext|>

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night
<|endoftext|>

reoccurrence
of cancer ---
no spring this year
<|endoftext|>

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha
<|endoftext|>

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again
<|endoftext|>

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter
<|endoftext|>

wisp of clouds
the slow spiral of cream
in my espresso
<|endoftext|>

almost dusk - 
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies
<|endoftext|>

at the hotel
plugging in my laptop
for a touch of home
<|endoftext|>

lifting fog --
a few white feathers
in the raven's breast
<|endoftext|>

the evening train
almost empty --
sundogs
<|endoftext|>

lenghtening days --
a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall
<|endoftext|>

week of rain --
the henna tatoo
fading fast
<|endoftext|>

low tide --
a shorebird's call
rises from the mud
<|endoftext|>

bank thermometers --
the temperature changes
all the way home
<|endoftext|>

wildfire haze
between the icebergs --
the blue wind
<|endoftext|>

dandelions --
I lose sight of
the yellow butterfly
<|endoftext|>

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats
<|endoftext|>

Sunday drive --
all the rain clouds
toward home
<|endoftext|>

summer salad --
a nasturtium burns
the tip of my tongue
<|endoftext|>

season's end --
the scent of fish
drifts downstream
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign
<|endoftext|>

dusk--
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam
<|endoftext|>

subzero --
the icicles filled
with moonlight
<|endoftext|>

new coolness --
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch
<|endoftext|>

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea
<|endoftext|>

long cold snap --
the icicle
begins to fork
<|endoftext|>

moss growing
on the manhole cover --
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

how quickly
the nights grow longer --
fireweed in bloom
<|endoftext|>

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls --
the mist
<|endoftext|>

a spider web
caught in my hand;
scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

a damp evening --
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats
<|endoftext|>

a long split
in the black inky cap --
snow clouds
<|endoftext|>

low clouds --
a gull circles above
the police car light
<|endoftext|>

snowy banks --
the drifting duck leans
into a curve
<|endoftext|>

my sweaty skin --
enough for three weeks
his ironed shirts
<|endoftext|>

beggar's steps
at the bakery
slower and slower
<|endoftext|>

my hand
    on her hip
         full moon
<|endoftext|>

rain
the white lilac
low
<|endoftext|>

over the hedge
a dragonfly
east
<|endoftext|>

Deep autumn;
The apple colder
In the tree.
<|endoftext|>

temple courtyard
through the morning fog
peach blossoms
<|endoftext|>

winter -
white peonies
in falling snow
<|endoftext|>

rain
falls from the trees
on the blue iris
<|endoftext|>

winter beach -
three grey lines
of sand, sea and sky
<|endoftext|>

through lace ~
the tracery of frost
on glass
<|endoftext|>

wisteria -
blooming before
the end of rain
<|endoftext|>

full moon
only you at my window
an empty face
<|endoftext|>

faintly purple
against the moon -
pines in the light
<|endoftext|>

the last light of day ~
purple rhododendrons
dissolve in the dark
<|endoftext|>

trembling
the hair ribbon falls
with inhibitions
<|endoftext|>

beautiful orange butterfly
lands on his shoulder~
oblivious
<|endoftext|>

brilliant Venus drips
from a gold crescent moon
this night as the first
<|endoftext|>

fogged window
a blend of green and gray -
hot tea with milk
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
dissolving cypress -
sfumato
<|endoftext|>

back and forth
grinding ink slowly
the weight of my words
<|endoftext|>

sand through fingers
a tracery of palms
on midnight blue
<|endoftext|>

silken winds
i am wrapped in quietness
of cottonwood seeds
<|endoftext|>

screen of pine
white silence glides
on egret wings
<|endoftext|>

after the fireworks
he marvels
at the moon
<|endoftext|>

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds
<|endoftext|>

for a moment
the gull in the air
is very white
<|endoftext|>

spring breeze--
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers
<|endoftext|>

evening sky
counting some fireflies
more than once
<|endoftext|>

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime
<|endoftext|>

putting a cork
in last night's wine
late autumn
<|endoftext|>

A cold morning;
the pink of tulips
through the mist.
<|endoftext|>

Purple loosestrife;
pale in the
lingering mist.
<|endoftext|>

November fog;
not a tree
to be seen.
<|endoftext|>

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air
<|endoftext|>

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window
<|endoftext|>

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
the tenderness
of light
<|endoftext|>

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
<|endoftext|>

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
<|endoftext|>

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end
<|endoftext|>

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
<|endoftext|>

alabaster moon ~
glowing among bare pine tops
in cool mountain mist
<|endoftext|>

kissing her slowly
where the rain
never falls
<|endoftext|>

smell of rain
young deer run
across the field
<|endoftext|>

white clouds
glide safely
over mine fields
<|endoftext|>

Herding sheep;
the prickly smell
of wet wool.
<|endoftext|>

Late summer;
the greyness of dusk
without fireflies.
<|endoftext|>

bus stop -
all eyes
on the migrating geese
<|endoftext|>

crashing waves-
my thoughts move
with the tide
<|endoftext|>

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein
<|endoftext|>

almost Christmas ~
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum
<|endoftext|>

behind net curtains
her face glides from window
to window
<|endoftext|>

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide
<|endoftext|>

ancient stone circle
the flow
of a robin's song
<|endoftext|>

her small fingers
tightly grip the pencil
--writing her new name
<|endoftext|>

house for sale--
the dandelions allowed
to bloom
<|endoftext|>

hot day--
the cool inside
an apple
<|endoftext|>

in the attic
the sound of march rain
so much louder
<|endoftext|>

A snowy footbridge
the sound of water
under the ice.
<|endoftext|>

Christmas dinner
grandma's fruit cake attracts
only blue jays
<|endoftext|>

A spring morning;
The pond's surface blurred
By raindrops.
<|endoftext|>

Afternoon rain;
Scents rise
From the garden.
<|endoftext|>

new buds
on old branches
once again
<|endoftext|>

summer afternoon
the scent of evergreens
slowly spreading
<|endoftext|>

looking at the sky
dandelions with haircuts
oh, that wind, that wind
<|endoftext|>

Autumn night --
Puddles by the wayside
filling with the stars
<|endoftext|>

void encroaches
as vision vanishes:
glaucoma wins
<|endoftext|>

graded papers
suddenly the rosebush
blooming
<|endoftext|>

beginning of winter
the snow piled high
on the lawn chairs
<|endoftext|>

Purple nights
fold into morning
whiteouts,
<|endoftext|>

stars
a full pool
in the garden
<|endoftext|>

through closed eyelids
lightning strikes
my dream
<|endoftext|>

cloudless sky
the gleam of fresh lemons
in a blue bowl
<|endoftext|>

late frost
warmth of the tea mug
against my cheek
<|endoftext|>

library return
her hand's warmth
lingers in the book
<|endoftext|>

breakfast alone--
I find the dove's feather
he left for me
<|endoftext|>

after the postman --
nothing in the mailbox
except a lizard
<|endoftext|>

November afternoon
the insistent bell
of an ice cream vendor
<|endoftext|>

A lull in the storm --
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.
<|endoftext|>

The thyme
has gone to seed --
summer's end.
<|endoftext|>

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg
<|endoftext|>

cold attic -
faded cigar box
filled with seashells
<|endoftext|>

antique store window
looking at dirty street snow
through colored bottles
<|endoftext|>

Eating alone --
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.
<|endoftext|>

One just sits;
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.
<|endoftext|>

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float;
Above the freeway noise.
<|endoftext|>

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders
<|endoftext|>

aged painter ~
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush
<|endoftext|>

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow
<|endoftext|>

stripping off
her sweatshirt ~
sparks in the dark
<|endoftext|>

A red berry falls
Staining the snow --
A silent sunset.
<|endoftext|>

This dark night;
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.
<|endoftext|>

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat
<|endoftext|>

a gloomy sunday
I sip my wine
and watch the rain
<|endoftext|>

long after
the funeral service
- the unspoken words
<|endoftext|>

on the roof late --
my brother hammers nails
in the moon
<|endoftext|>

mid-summer --
the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven
<|endoftext|>

cold spring --
burnt waffles
and raspberry jam
<|endoftext|>

cold nose
burrow of warm flannel -
morning light
<|endoftext|>

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages --
haijin's notebook
<|endoftext|>

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters
<|endoftext|>

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs
<|endoftext|>

Wind howls and
the cedars sway --
drunken sailors
<|endoftext|>

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift
<|endoftext|>

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises
<|endoftext|>

Still under white sheet
his body four hours later-
Rain beats on pavement.
<|endoftext|>

Mother's Day;
the smell of roses
near a grave.
<|endoftext|>

autumn's end
the air smells
different
<|endoftext|>

candlelight bath
the steam rises
from my toes
<|endoftext|>

Now the shore is grey
and the wind is sharp with rain.
Some day we'll sit close
<|endoftext|>

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable
<|endoftext|>

morning tai chi ~
a breeze stirs the spent petals
of the cherry blossoms
<|endoftext|>

birdsong ~
the rush of the river
over stones
<|endoftext|>

spring afternoon ~
the leaf shadow spreads
on the pond
<|endoftext|>

contact lenses ~
the pines on that hill clear
for the first time
<|endoftext|>

open suitcase ~
she reads the oncology report
backwards
<|endoftext|>

before my door
your footprints in the snow
from last night
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
the low from street lamps
still lingers
<|endoftext|>

bamboo flute
the scent
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

at the end
of a long learning curve
a helmut of white hair
<|endoftext|>

midwinter vanished
in a bite of homemade
strawberry preserves
<|endoftext|>

while washing spinach
how nice to find
a haiku there
<|endoftext|>

at the feeder
more birds than room
the smell of snow
<|endoftext|>

5am--
bird songs lost
in air conditioner noise
<|endoftext|>

mud puddles
leaving behind
a high heel
<|endoftext|>

cold starry night -
from the forest edge the sound
of animal kill
<|endoftext|>

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup
<|endoftext|>

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic
<|endoftext|>

market forecast:
record warmth
followed by rain
<|endoftext|>

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons
<|endoftext|>

my son's eleventh birthday --
miles of cold gray rain
between us
<|endoftext|>

Mass Pike trafic
the bright red glare
of her lipstick
<|endoftext|>

reflecting
the graffiti landscape
Soho rain
<|endoftext|>

first date --
under the streetlight
our shadows hold hands
<|endoftext|>

tent revival
the preacher's wife
in a miracle bra
<|endoftext|>

asleep on the train
the gentle rise and fall
of her breasts
<|endoftext|>

commuter daydream --
I follow the slit in her skirt
into oncoming trafic
<|endoftext|>

her well-tanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater --
the end of summer
<|endoftext|>

the NASDAQ falls --
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone
<|endoftext|>

troubled sleep --
somewhere in the darkness
an unlocked door
<|endoftext|>

staring at her neckline
the deep plunge
of the NASDAQ
<|endoftext|>

lunch hour --
the automatic teller machine
eats my card
<|endoftext|>

Veterans' cemetery--
a wide expanse of lawn
beyond the graves.
<|endoftext|>

A pear;
A worm's hole leaves
a bitter taste.
<|endoftext|>

flea market -
a sitting buddha
on his left side
<|endoftext|>

new cracks
in an old mirror
I just noticed
<|endoftext|>

autumn storm
lightning flashes
on buddah's belly
<|endoftext|>

while dusting buddha's mouth
is smile disappeared
for a few seconds
<|endoftext|>

April shower -
last drop
of green tea
<|endoftext|>

Morning fog -
only the scent of
eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance
<|endoftext|>

heat storm--
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder
<|endoftext|>

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain
<|endoftext|>

distant thoughts-
the last ember
cools
<|endoftext|>

more wine?
he places an afghan
around my shoulders
<|endoftext|>

pilgrim counts
every second step
stone in shoe
<|endoftext|>

trinitarian glasses
help both speaker and listeners
to see more clearly
<|endoftext|>

unmown grass
in the cemetery -
lighting bugs
<|endoftext|>

flooded paddies
floating rice shoots -
relentless rain
<|endoftext|>

a hundred thousand spectators
three laureates
a moth
<|endoftext|>

not breathing
Japanese cranes
pausing in the snow
<|endoftext|>

molten by a morning sun
frozen cranes take wing
one by one
<|endoftext|>

bamboo flute
mournful notes flying
to an absent moon
<|endoftext|>

still smiling
water beads and drips
off Buddha's nose
<|endoftext|>

dusk breeze
another birthday spent
viewing others
<|endoftext|>

forest silence. . .
the cool green glow of lichen
wet with sunlit steam
<|endoftext|>

old village. . .
mosquitos enough
for everyone
<|endoftext|>

sweeping leaves. . .
her lovesong interupted
by a sigh
<|endoftext|>

autumn trail
the smell of something wild
lingers
<|endoftext|>

thunder
slate sky
crocus peeking
<|endoftext|>

kitchen encounter ~
tasting the wine
from his lips
<|endoftext|>

summer sidewalk -
drops of rain
steam
<|endoftext|>

water bed
dreams
undulating
<|endoftext|>

against the glass -
her palm prints
linger
<|endoftext|>

nude beach
about size
and sighs
<|endoftext|>

on her nape
beads of rain
slowly I follow them down
<|endoftext|>

in three short sentences

on his napkin
<|endoftext|>

delivered
in the cold rain
<|endoftext|>

dying afternoon light
the doctor touches her
uncombed hair
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
candle too short
for lingering night
<|endoftext|>

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen
<|endoftext|>

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd
<|endoftext|>

midnight--
the changing wind
in the silver maples
<|endoftext|>

painting
the dark side of the house--
solstice
<|endoftext|>

evening traffic -
caught in a low moon
the heron's flight
<|endoftext|>

Under the Magnolia
red seeds float away--
November rain.
<|endoftext|>

Distant thunder--
the smell of rain
before the storm.
<|endoftext|>

November clouds-
hearing of
my sister's illness...
<|endoftext|>

old pond
after the frog
the stillness
<|endoftext|>

fresh cut lawn
a dozen fireflies
inspect the job
<|endoftext|>

How thin the moon!
the scent of lilacs
grows fainter...
<|endoftext|>

picking up his toys
still in my funeral clothes
the very last time
<|endoftext|>

in the lap
of a stone Buddha
fresh snow
<|endoftext|>

in her eyes
the end our date
the moon
<|endoftext|>

the slow drift...
sunbeam across
an empty room
<|endoftext|>

Sunday morning
smells of French toast
and cinnamon...
<|endoftext|>

a lost dream
cellular phone
on the night train
<|endoftext|>

the colour of wind
through pine trees
must be blue
<|endoftext|>

a yellow woman
applies lipstick
<|endoftext|>

lighthouse
above the sound
silence
<|endoftext|>

mother daughter
lunch
storm and thunder

the lingering taste
of too many aspirin
<|endoftext|>

dark lamp shade--
squinting her eyes in low light
to read your letter
<|endoftext|>

tuesday sunrise
spilling grains of sugar
in my black tea
<|endoftext|>

beautiful blue
the pattern in your eyes
before death drained their color
<|endoftext|>

beach house
a bit of sand
in my tea
<|endoftext|>

pale legs
under a white moon~
shivering aspen
<|endoftext|>

sad news
the blur of reading
through tears
<|endoftext|>

summer haze
the thin gauze
of her white dress
<|endoftext|>

failed copy
the real iris bluer
than the photograph
<|endoftext|>

bullfrog chorus
one a little louder
than the rest
<|endoftext|>

moonless night
a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea
<|endoftext|>

what if
the flavor of burnt toast
is in the fallen seed
<|endoftext|>

christmas album
every year he wears
the same flannel shirt
<|endoftext|>

murmur of rain
hard to catch the words
when he talks in his sleep
<|endoftext|>

warm rain
smells of tar, dirt,
and snails
<|endoftext|>

winter morning --
this egg and me
in the kitchen
<|endoftext|>

a gull gliding
out of the cloud's shadow -
suddenly white
<|endoftext|>

freight train
a load of snow
going south
<|endoftext|>

The New Millenium
brought to my window
two new icycles
<|endoftext|>

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home
<|endoftext|>

new leaves
pattered by rain . . .
cardinal song
<|endoftext|>

Chechnya ~
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering
<|endoftext|>

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
. . . again and again . . .
<|endoftext|>

into shadows
<|endoftext|>

young girls in fog --

fluffing tobacco
<|endoftext|>

moon and mist ~
night settles into silence
and white breath
<|endoftext|>

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist
<|endoftext|>

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous
<|endoftext|>

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface
<|endoftext|>

a B-52
thunders over the bay--
blue heron lifting
<|endoftext|>

through the window
five minutes between projects
watching the pansies dancing
<|endoftext|>

flashing against

<|endoftext|>

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light
<|endoftext|>

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs
<|endoftext|>

boardwalking--

drops through a crack
<|endoftext|>

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table
<|endoftext|>

noon --

roll from the valley
<|endoftext|>

slowly ...
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection
<|endoftext|>

the perfect symmetry
of a moth
<|endoftext|>

distant thunder-
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf
<|endoftext|>

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones
<|endoftext|>

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox
<|endoftext|>

onto moss

at the sickle moon

<|endoftext|>

streetlight
my shadow growing
fading
<|endoftext|>

heads to the barn
<|endoftext|>

for this path

from the bottle

July early morning---
a jogger carries
two bottles of water
<|endoftext|>

tea leaves carefully
saved, dried, and used again
hidden poverty
<|endoftext|>

the future
deep in the tea leaves ...
spring growth
<|endoftext|>

stifling heat --
our new neighbors'
argument
<|endoftext|>

heat wave --
the dog moves slowly
from shadow to shadow
<|endoftext|>

restless night --
a tree frog
in and out of tune
<|endoftext|>

rose petals
fallen on bare earth
evening rain
<|endoftext|>

July sunset---
after a hot day
the watermelon tastes cool
<|endoftext|>

sunrise---
my neighbor in her underwear
July's last day
<|endoftext|>

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can
<|endoftext|>

her Alzheimer's
a dragonfly
goes . . . comes
<|endoftext|>

wildflower bouquet
left on a country highway
the endless road
<|endoftext|>

back to my hometown
blooming with a sweet scent
mom's oriental lilies
<|endoftext|>

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money
<|endoftext|>

sudden chill --
an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home
<|endoftext|>

waning moon --
a hand-printed sign reads:
"lost dog"
<|endoftext|>

cricket song
my longing too
unanswered
<|endoftext|>

moon phase
the welfare check
comes on the fifth
<|endoftext|>

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?
<|endoftext|>

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles
<|endoftext|>

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

(Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain
<|endoftext|>

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes
<|endoftext|>

bag of beer
snail trails leave it
from all directions
<|endoftext|>

charred goat bones
they say -- without conviction 
Somali nightmares
<|endoftext|>

too hot for miso!
he pushes it aside
that August morning
<|endoftext|>

August blue sky---
the smell of sunscreen
in the subway
<|endoftext|>

morning haze---
a beach beauty goes
topless
<|endoftext|>

Hiroshima Day---
a Japanese ballerina
dances on pointe
<|endoftext|>

Summer park---
every one is busy
viewing their phone screens
<|endoftext|>

August 6--
my father does not say
good morning
<|endoftext|>

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north
<|endoftext|>

fighting
the summer heat -
no time for poetry
<|endoftext|>

sunflower
the day passing
slowly
<|endoftext|>

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day
<|endoftext|>

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon
<|endoftext|>

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence
<|endoftext|>

Hazy skies
the cedars less dark
this Summer day
<|endoftext|>

Crickets in the garden
time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands
<|endoftext|>

My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away 
<|endoftext|>

late August garbage bags---
a jasmine tree
near by
<|endoftext|>

mackerel sky
first gold leaves spangle
the maple
<|endoftext|>

autumn equinox --
my baseball glove
right where I left it
<|endoftext|>

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail
<|endoftext|>

teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

Summer barber shop---
sudden silence
as a blonde bombshell comes in
<|endoftext|>

Summer sunset---
she ties her bikini top
before she gets up
<|endoftext|>

flea market shopping---
you may have to pay in blood
the bedbugs scare
<|endoftext|>

sunset---
as the train starts
to enter the tunnel
<|endoftext|>

East River night
cool September wind---
lovers stay in their cars
<|endoftext|>

perseid shower
the intake of her breath...
another contraction
<|endoftext|>

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning
<|endoftext|>

menopause -
she even quarrels with
the autumn moon
<|endoftext|>

neither white nor black
a yellow smog that won't lift
Alzheimer's pall
<|endoftext|>

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall
<|endoftext|>

glassy-eyed, gutted
catch of the day on shaved ice
at the fish market
<|endoftext|>

Rain clouds
patches of blue in the sky
first cup of coffee
<|endoftext|>

In the morning darkness
coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine
<|endoftext|>

Fall morning
fog resting on cedars
cup of Kona
<|endoftext|>

Fall afternoon
the boat on the river
slow heart beating
<|endoftext|>

East Side skyline---
the UN building looks
more like a hospital
<|endoftext|>

dark clouds move
in between skyscrapers---
the Dow goes down
<|endoftext|>

East River warm Autumn day---
a red oil tanker
zigzags
<|endoftext|>

sunset over the sea
I remember when my mother
ran faster than me
<|endoftext|>

graveside service
slipping from Grandma's book
pressed wildflowers
<|endoftext|>

middle of the night
my fingers tick tick ticking
a hot flash haiku
<|endoftext|>

night fishing -
my rod-tip brushes
the milky way
<|endoftext|>

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal
<|endoftext|>

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed
<|endoftext|>

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon gleaners
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field
<|endoftext|>

Summer's day
the clink of ice cubes
in my gin and tonic
<|endoftext|>

Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns
this Autumn day
<|endoftext|>

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
an abandoned car
on lover's lane
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
a missing
mouse trap
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
the mouse in the ceiling
awakens
<|endoftext|>

evening fog---
the cars parked on the beach
have their windows fogged out
<|endoftext|>

september morning -
fresh flowers
on the roadside shrine
<|endoftext|>

making a u-turn
clear in the rear view mirror
autumn afternoon
<|endoftext|>

the War on Horror---
G.I.'s on hashish kill
Afghans for sport
<|endoftext|>

I turn off the pumpkin lights---
a predawn
harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

white roadside crosses
where the road's swale meets Nature
memento mori
<|endoftext|>

first frost
why did I never
plant evergreens?
<|endoftext|>

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle
<|endoftext|>

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain
<|endoftext|>

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku
<|endoftext|>

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars
<|endoftext|>

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows
<|endoftext|>

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull
<|endoftext|>

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you
<|endoftext|>

A wind up frog
hops across the wooden floor
thoughts of haiku
<|endoftext|>

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumn's abundance
<|endoftext|>

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon
<|endoftext|>

chrysanthemum moon
the way
you open me
<|endoftext|>

leaf after leaf falls
the way your laugh
makes me laugh
<|endoftext|>

october over
listening to heavy rain
call to prayer
<|endoftext|>

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha
<|endoftext|>

afternoon fog
the point of the meeting
getting lost
<|endoftext|>

a red cloud
on the horizon
robin's song
<|endoftext|>

valentine's day
a patch of snow
the sun hasn't found
<|endoftext|>

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash
<|endoftext|>

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen
<|endoftext|>

morning fog---
the dry cleaner says
he can't find my coat
<|endoftext|>

evening fog---
some one behind me
speaks in Cockney
<|endoftext|>

Daylight Saving Time starts---
the cat still awakes
when it's hungry
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon at sunset---
she hesitates then
kisses me
<|endoftext|>

as she sits at the bar---
her jeans slide
a half moon
<|endoftext|>

sometimes
sunny sundays in november
are unfair
<|endoftext|>

sunny sunday in november
half assembled shelves
wait in the kitchen
<|endoftext|>

sunday in autumn
neighbor needs money
for her cancer meds
<|endoftext|>

november email
remembering sycamores
outside the window
<|endoftext|>

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call
<|endoftext|>

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials
<|endoftext|>

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day
<|endoftext|>

overcast --
just one more game
of solitaire
<|endoftext|>

more rain --
a mouse trapped
between walls
<|endoftext|>

autumn wind
knowing what you
will say next
<|endoftext|>

maple in full flame
becoming at last
myself
<|endoftext|>

we race dry leaves
down the road home
the north wind and me
<|endoftext|>

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold half-moon
<|endoftext|>

dull in a crescent's light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood
<|endoftext|>

blizzard-
the slanting lines, piercing lines
our locked hands
<|endoftext|>

first frost--
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers
<|endoftext|>

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light
<|endoftext|>

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages
<|endoftext|>

he turns one last time
flashing his sailor's wry smile
that bright November.
<|endoftext|>

On the island
the first snowfall
red gloves
<|endoftext|>

First mandarin
sweet and sour taste
scent of Christmas
<|endoftext|>

midnight moon--
afraid
to turn another page
<|endoftext|>

afraid of a boy
with an old man's eyes
needles of frost
<|endoftext|>

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors
<|endoftext|>

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest
<|endoftext|>

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair
<|endoftext|>

Earth Day...
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect
<|endoftext|>

a break in the clouds --
my third cup of coffee
grows cold
<|endoftext|>

clear skies --
a solitary crow
on a high-voltage wire
<|endoftext|>

November dusk --
do the streetlights know
how early it is?
<|endoftext|>

November dusk --
the warmth
of a familiar song
<|endoftext|>

evening fog---
the cat comes back
with an appetite
<|endoftext|>

first frost
another wish
goes on their list
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving
a new seat
at the table
<|endoftext|>

new highway -
every mile or so
the corpse of a buzzard
<|endoftext|>

Snowballs
her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one
<|endoftext|>

Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window 
Advents candles blow out
<|endoftext|>

Winter solstice
too many things to do
this shortest of days
<|endoftext|>

shortest day
flames dance
in the oven
<|endoftext|>

shortest day--
her countdown to christmas
quickens
<|endoftext|>

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms
<|endoftext|>

the noise of a garbage truck
wakes me up---
December harvest moon
<|endoftext|>

Christmas Day nears---
the shopping bags
get smaller
<|endoftext|>

lengthening days
I turn the Christmas lights
off
<|endoftext|>

snow day --
more white than I remember
in my beard
<|endoftext|>

footprints in the snow
words
I can't take back
<|endoftext|>

girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow--
lost too soon
<|endoftext|>

day after Christmas-
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits
<|endoftext|>

the corridor
was long and dark...
news of your death
<|endoftext|>

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain
<|endoftext|>

New Year's Eve--
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes
<|endoftext|>

credit crunch -
a half-dozen fireworks
greet the new year
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope
<|endoftext|>

snowy morn--
pouring another cup
of black coffee
<|endoftext|>

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon
<|endoftext|>

1 11 11
too many smoking
chimneys
<|endoftext|>

morning cloudy sky---
she comes out of the shower
wrapped in a towel
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon---
she paints only the tips
of her finger nails
<|endoftext|>

New Year's morning -
I wipe some dirt
from my glasses
<|endoftext|>

blizzard -
the heavy weight
of snowflakes
<|endoftext|>

the sulphuric scent
of winter coal
out for a walk
<|endoftext|>

making soup
my hands could be
my mother's hands
<|endoftext|>

awake too early
trees shrouded in mist
the slow tick of a clock
<|endoftext|>

the damp stain on the wall
only looks like a damp stain -
Monday morning
<|endoftext|>

deep winter
igniting the match
with a lit candle
<|endoftext|>

cold sunshine -
the icicles refuse
to melt
<|endoftext|>

cold night -
the deeper levels of dreams
and fears
<|endoftext|>

when celsius
and farenheit meet -
cold night
<|endoftext|>

deep winter--
nothing much to say
even among crows
<|endoftext|>

a second glass of wine -
the poem goes
unwritten
<|endoftext|>

I put out the night garbage---
a Wolf
Moon
<|endoftext|>

fresh snow on the roofs---
the old graffiti looks
dirtier 
<|endoftext|>

Saturday night---
talk of the recent snow storms
is a good ice breaker
<|endoftext|>

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear
<|endoftext|>

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll
<|endoftext|>

daylight
in the winter haze
a faint birdsong
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
my new dahlias too
look so faded 
<|endoftext|>

the cat shifts
from sunspot to sunspot
Sunday morning
<|endoftext|>

snow turns to rain --
the afterglow
of the plow lights
<|endoftext|>

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one
<|endoftext|>

first frost--
the last of the roses
have lost their names
<|endoftext|>

sleet and rain-
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush
<|endoftext|>

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice
<|endoftext|>

blank date book-
the gray afternoon
turns to white
<|endoftext|>

Rainy February day
Cloud after cloud after cloud
Pray for a clear day
<|endoftext|>

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind
<|endoftext|>

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono
<|endoftext|>

Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese
Spring is here
<|endoftext|>

airport window--
the cloud of my breath
as your plane reaches the clouds
<|endoftext|>

loosening
the top button of her blouse
with my eyes
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt -
the garden blooms
with children's toys
<|endoftext|>

tasting
the freckle on her cleavage
with my eyes
<|endoftext|>

sunset---
the Empire State Building is lit
in red and yellow
<|endoftext|>

Saturday night fog---
so many girls here
have a hoarse voice
<|endoftext|>

sunset---
her gray sweater lifts
to show her navel
<|endoftext|>

her eyes---
a hesitant dog leads
a woman into a subway car
<|endoftext|>

snowstorm
too many flakes
for haiku
<|endoftext|>

the crowd 
holding blossoms . . . 
thunder!
<|endoftext|>

love letters -
i rake the embers
of the fire
<|endoftext|>

camellia buds -
my wife begins
to cradle her belly
<|endoftext|>

her head
bent over tea leaves . . .
how old she's grown
<|endoftext|>

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine
<|endoftext|>

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock -
the winter wind
<|endoftext|>

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love
<|endoftext|>

w?nter sesshin
in the kitchen
my cracked teacup
<|endoftext|>

after winter sesshin
sharing tea
silence
<|endoftext|>

winter's cold
dreaming
of my ex-wife
<|endoftext|>

table 4 2
- a romance reduced
to numbers
<|endoftext|>

three sneezes
all that's left
of the snowman
<|endoftext|>

freezing rain
the words
I cannot take back
<|endoftext|>

share a smile
<|endoftext|>

coming in to land

foghorns
<|endoftext|>

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road
<|endoftext|>

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime
<|endoftext|>

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter
<|endoftext|>

recycling
old gold
<|endoftext|>

commuter traffic
no light to stop
a starling flock
<|endoftext|>

taps my office window
<|endoftext|>

i arrange my tie
to hide a stain
misty hollow
<|endoftext|>

supermarket sign
the melancholia magnified
by drizzle
<|endoftext|>

february dawn
the rhubarb rises
a deeper red
<|endoftext|>

sudden downpour -
the memory of a butterfly
washed away
<|endoftext|>

cloudy at sunset---
black and white graffiti 
shows more leg
<|endoftext|>

a rain storm ends---
the graffiti looks
dirtier than before
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat
<|endoftext|>

one plus one = 3 
a happy couple expecting
their first child

is spring coming
bombs raining down
on tripoli on aljazeera
<|endoftext|>

Fountain pen ink spill
not contained by a blotter 
Mare Crisium
<|endoftext|>

mountain rain -
the beetle and i
scurry for cover
<|endoftext|>

roadside memorial -
the faded plastic windmills
still racing
<|endoftext|>

secrets--
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight
<|endoftext|>

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms
<|endoftext|>

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts
<|endoftext|>

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus
<|endoftext|>

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee
<|endoftext|>

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning
<|endoftext|>

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds
<|endoftext|>

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board
<|endoftext|>

my place in another world
kept by a bookmark
<|endoftext|>

Satie -

eases
<|endoftext|>

black run
a skier's cigarette
points downhill
<|endoftext|>

crocus breeze -
my dying mother's words
come back to me
<|endoftext|>

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain
<|endoftext|>

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand
<|endoftext|>

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex
<|endoftext|>

Soft rain
My Mother and I look
At retirement homes

from the latin mass
<|endoftext|>

to Sendai . . .
so much just gone

of the Buddha; a reminder
everything passes.

a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow

shoots among the lilies
she can't name
<|endoftext|>

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes
<|endoftext|>

mirror
her mother's lips

in a barbed wire fence

on the rusty fire escape

A new scent

in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring

in my bones

on my window

to keep out the cold
<|endoftext|>

dried leaves
hurry down the path
standard time

so carefully that morning 
that will end the war

till the next

<|endoftext|>

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair
<|endoftext|>

out on the bay

much more haunting

a can of worms
<|endoftext|>

Right, left
The flash of the float plane's light
Rain on the forest

from a cane pole
<|endoftext|>

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths
<|endoftext|>

faster
<|endoftext|>

withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes
<|endoftext|>

the rising moon pales
down here the cricket's
unwavering song
<|endoftext|>

high-stepping,
an egret walks its shadow
across a white wall
<|endoftext|>

still the spent firework's
cordite smell -
nest of serpents
<|endoftext|>

dogwood flowers unfold
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

rusty fence - 
a sunbird
in one of the diamonds
<|endoftext|>

where we buried the cat

as he runs indoors

after my comment

we sip bitter coffee
rehashing last night
<|endoftext|>

bends the candle's flame
<|endoftext|>

last night's hail
<|endoftext|>

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain
<|endoftext|>

fighting illness-

of the new year
<|endoftext|>

over cold champagne
<|endoftext|>

past midnight

lights up the room
<|endoftext|>

warm drizzle
cinnamon buns
and tea for two
<|endoftext|>

on a bronze temple bell
just before ringing
<|endoftext|>

severe frost -

looting from bins
<|endoftext|>

restless -
across the summer night
siren upon siren
<|endoftext|>

so huge
<|endoftext|>

evening voices

at snowflakes
<|endoftext|>

Easter Sunday
the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest
<|endoftext|>

reading
the tea leaves . . . the gray
in her hair
<|endoftext|>

In front of bronze doors
they huddle against the cold
the newly homeless
<|endoftext|>

a cup of tea
and a koan to go -
my cold morning
<|endoftext|>

two dog walkers
meet -
two conversations
<|endoftext|>

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse -
still the new shoots
<|endoftext|>

on the fireman's helmet
a faint smell of smoke
<|endoftext|>

frozen dawn
the runner recovering
in his own steam

on asphalt

carries a moth
to the moon

lonely butterfly
in the quiet morning light
where are you going?
<|endoftext|>

in the oak tree
mourning doves
<|endoftext|>

Just a small basket
filled with hidden treasures
she carries proudly
<|endoftext|>

an ant in my bed-
for the two of us
not enough room
<|endoftext|>

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age

on the window
<|endoftext|>

two babblers on a wire
and then the moon
<|endoftext|>

midnight -
the windy silence
of the sickle moon
<|endoftext|>

after the solstice
this summer heat
still the same
<|endoftext|>

night drizzle
is that donkey's braying
filled with pain?

on the fog
<|endoftext|>

indian summer --
an unsealed letter
on the table
<|endoftext|>

that cricket -

through the window
half a mirror showing
a quarter room
<|endoftext|>

another old tune
<|endoftext|>

of his last chemo cap

the water sounds

for an opinion
<|endoftext|>

cough louder
<|endoftext|>

rumble of thunder-

for the pie
<|endoftext|>

back over his shoulder
autumn grass
<|endoftext|>

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit
<|endoftext|>

waited for
<|endoftext|>

what I do

glitter

flood the market

to draw a rainbow

fog out

effaced by the flood
<|endoftext|>

red poppies growing
between rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance
<|endoftext|>

Winter sunset---
the whistle of a
Florida bound train
<|endoftext|>

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word
<|endoftext|>

neon veil
a neighbour's lights
outshine the moon
<|endoftext|>

in an old snapshot
his Irish smile still flashes
her slight, shy smile, too
<|endoftext|>

a sweetness
on the breeze
<|endoftext|>

after a storm
the absence
of a tree
<|endoftext|>

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

fine gray rain
a flashmob of santas
in union square
<|endoftext|>

hurried steps
my frosty breath rises towards
the half moon
<|endoftext|>

undecided voter
half a moon hangs
in the noon sky
<|endoftext|>

a cooing is heard
from a small puff of feathers
another dawn
<|endoftext|>

small green waves crashing
against a porcelain rim
morning tea tempest
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids
<|endoftext|>

endless rain

a wait for rain
<|endoftext|>

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire
<|endoftext|>

overcast morning
the smell of steaming rice---
Summer
<|endoftext|>

night silence -
despite the dogs, despite
a crying baby
<|endoftext|>

a toast
to the departing year -
snow turns to rain
<|endoftext|>

My tea gets colder
and the madeleine just sinks
memory betrays
<|endoftext|>

under snow
the same earth
waiting waiting
<|endoftext|>

red lobster-
her prying glance
through the mist
<|endoftext|>

mixing bowls-
the shallow echoes
of bells
<|endoftext|>

thunder snow
the wind-shifting scent
of fox
<|endoftext|>

Gare du Nord
the slow change of snow
on fake fur
<|endoftext|>

almost lost
among the shifting hues
of dusk
<|endoftext|>

red poppies...
the butterfly always just
out of reach
<|endoftext|>

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath
<|endoftext|>

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight
<|endoftext|>

unaimed day -
beneath the flipped stone
five black beetles
<|endoftext|>

cricket song
softly, outlasting
the trucks
<|endoftext|>

sunrise---
a ray of light hits
my bathroom mirror
<|endoftext|>

woodfire
flickering in the silence
corralled horses
<|endoftext|>

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to
<|endoftext|>

habemus papam!
I've always loved
Latino men
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses
<|endoftext|>

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog
<|endoftext|>

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow
<|endoftext|>

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes
<|endoftext|>

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses
<|endoftext|>

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn
<|endoftext|>

lullaby of rain
another pinch of saffron
in the pumpkin soup
<|endoftext|>

At rest
in the crow's nest
crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

In Morse code
the woodpecker
announces spring
<|endoftext|>

On the Ferris wheel
reaching up
to stroke the moon
<|endoftext|>

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday
<|endoftext|>

first day of spring
stubborn icicles 
still hang on
<|endoftext|>

equinox -
the bulbul's song on the edge
between day and night
<|endoftext|>

spring evening -
a boy hums the tune I heard
half a mile ago
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone
<|endoftext|>

train whistle
a blackbird hops
along its notes
<|endoftext|>

the moon is broken
Battersea Power Station
from a train window
<|endoftext|>

Valentine's Day
my wife reads up
on Henry VIII
<|endoftext|>

zombie debt-
the practised slice
of a bread knife
<|endoftext|>

Not so good
for all the fish
Good Friday
<|endoftext|>

St. Patrick's Day
in front of the pub
yellow pouring out of the daffodils
<|endoftext|>

dawn haze -
the bulbul's trills
so clear
<|endoftext|>

midnight -
only jasmine now
and cricket song
<|endoftext|>

April 2nd
the snow
still lying
<|endoftext|>

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring
<|endoftext|>

summer rain -
lightning whites out
the street lights
<|endoftext|>

the crow -
balancing on a wire
and now, in the wind
<|endoftext|>

Boston news
a crazy day and yet
that butterfly
<|endoftext|>

dockside fight
french fries in a pile
of seagulls
<|endoftext|>

childhood's summer gift
that first dandelion
dancing on the wind
<|endoftext|>

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven
<|endoftext|>

heavy rain
a darkening sky
behind her face
<|endoftext|>

Sunday afternoon
bittersweet chocolate
and swapped addresses
<|endoftext|>

Sunday dusk
a last wine bottle
piled in the trunk
<|endoftext|>

El Hueso's dry bones
still wrapped in a uniform 
that he so disgraced.
<|endoftext|>

old, brittle, dry bones
found inside a uniform 
a past imperfect
<|endoftext|>

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach
<|endoftext|>

Fragrant spring blossom
children play outside until
there is no more light.
<|endoftext|>

morning stillness
a bird song
I've never heard before
<|endoftext|>

sunday sermon
children's voices 
mix with the choir
<|endoftext|>

Mother's Day
everytime
she calls
<|endoftext|>

a few petals
left by the sweeper . . .
sunset clouds
<|endoftext|>

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils
<|endoftext|>

leaver's day
a wind too strong
for butterflies
<|endoftext|>

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret
<|endoftext|>

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon
<|endoftext|>

small town café
only strangers
get menus
<|endoftext|>

storm warning...
a street corner argument
turns many heads
<|endoftext|>

sunny afternoon
sand swept
behind the door
<|endoftext|>

middle of the night
on a wicked wind
passing news
<|endoftext|>

a careful sip
more of chickpea than coffee
his breakfast brew
<|endoftext|>

croaking of frogs
just after dawn
summer memories
<|endoftext|>

silk from a web
entangled in my hair
a homeless spider 
<|endoftext|>

Before dawn
By the small pond
The sound of crickets
<|endoftext|>

chamomile petals
swimming in rainwater
for her blonde highlights
<|endoftext|>

Splat !
a windshield and a bug
find each other
<|endoftext|>

polished granite
reflects my face off
my father's grave
<|endoftext|>

desert landscape
rain will come and the water...
remembers each path
<|endoftext|>

heavy rain--
the old rubber boots
not tall enough
<|endoftext|>

heavy rain--
my flower seeds sprout
in the neighbor's yard
<|endoftext|>

evening rain
she lets down
her hair
<|endoftext|>

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow
<|endoftext|>

the laughter of children
running uphill . . ;
Gettysburg
<|endoftext|>

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter . . .
distant fireworks
<|endoftext|>

heavy rain--
the rotten boat 
tries to float again
<|endoftext|>

heavy rain--
in the farm belt
barbershops fill up
<|endoftext|>

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door
<|endoftext|>

Gazing at the moon
on a still summer's evening
feast for mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>

Clouds gather
in a darkening sky
a walk interrupted 
<|endoftext|>

a true wonder of the world --
how she fills
her Grand Canyon t-shirt
<|endoftext|>

the silence
around our words . . .
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

tang of salt spray
at a fishing pier
late summer
<|endoftext|>

lighting the way
with a jar of fireflies
childhood's last summer 
<|endoftext|>

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
hereyes reflect stars
<|endoftext|>

night rain -
Chopin's nocturne
drowns it out
<|endoftext|>

after a long night
the singing of birds
at dawn
<|endoftext|>

cold night
the hallway nightlight
flickers on and off
<|endoftext|>

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak 
<|endoftext|>

ash covers his school desk
all the remains
8:17 am -- Hiroshima, local time
<|endoftext|>

brush in hand
he carefully...
8:16, local time, Hiroshima
<|endoftext|>

in a pile of rubble
faint peeps are heard
rats, of course
<|endoftext|>

ebb tide's retreat
and I grow older
recessionals
<|endoftext|>

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima
<|endoftext|>

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap . . .
this heat
<|endoftext|>

cheap motel
the desk clerk
turns a blind eye
<|endoftext|>

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette
<|endoftext|>

rumble of thunder
rouses dawn
late summer in Miami
<|endoftext|>

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front
<|endoftext|>

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes
<|endoftext|>

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane
<|endoftext|>

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
she tells him
she's late
<|endoftext|>

They share 
a bruised apple
moonlit feast for two
<|endoftext|>

Harvest moon --
too much light
for field mice
<|endoftext|>

summer rains gone
the river
finds its own channel
<|endoftext|>

his name 
on the black granite wall
and we must ask, why ?
<|endoftext|>

October rain 
all through the night 
my kidney stone
<|endoftext|>

blood on barbed wire
a pale moon
reveals the crime
<|endoftext|>

Red fall foliage
the Sun at noon
glorious
<|endoftext|>

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs
<|endoftext|>

Croton hedges 
with their faux fall foliage
South Florida in autumn
<|endoftext|>

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks
<|endoftext|>

shortening days ...
the petals fall
into dust
<|endoftext|>

the moon
and my wine glass
half full
<|endoftext|>

town landfill --
old timers
arguing politics
<|endoftext|>

stock market report --
a stalled car
in the intersection
<|endoftext|>

Day of the Dead --
all the leftover
Halloween candy
<|endoftext|>

hunter's moon --
searching
for my keys
<|endoftext|>

To the Finland Station --
they rush
to strike a deal for iPhones
<|endoftext|>

cat's paws crawling
across a lake's surface
morning silence
<|endoftext|>

cold night --
I become
the dog's pillow
<|endoftext|>

first snow --
an almost
perfect shave
<|endoftext|>

fair-weather clouds --
an ultrasound
of my next grandchild
<|endoftext|>

more piercing
in the autumn mist
the blackbird's song
<|endoftext|>

asleep
a golden dot on her ear
bus forty one
<|endoftext|>

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent
<|endoftext|>

behind the cafe
the sound of children--
or crows
<|endoftext|>

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow --- 
<|endoftext|>

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star --- 
<|endoftext|>

darkening skies --
the final hours
of the weekend
<|endoftext|>

autumn morning
the smell of fresh rain
in my coffee
<|endoftext|>

homebound ferry
thoughts zigzagging
with the terns
<|endoftext|>

hot summer day
a bowl of picked berries
without sugar
<|endoftext|>

beach house -
unlocking the gate
to the ocean
<|endoftext|>

in and out
of the haiku lesson -
the fragrance of the lilies
<|endoftext|>

open window
the moon's reflection
in the toilet bowl
<|endoftext|>

jogging at dusk
around the neighborhood
the smell of garlic
<|endoftext|>

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse
<|endoftext|>

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking
<|endoftext|>

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset
<|endoftext|>

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood
<|endoftext|>

november blossom --
a brightness to find
what might have been lost
<|endoftext|>

deep autumn
there's wind enough to winnow
wild rice
<|endoftext|>

our parting kiss
a mixture of salt
and sweet peppers
<|endoftext|>

Fog on the mountain,
Rain tapping the window pane,
Cup of tea, steaming.
<|endoftext|>

her lips
beckoning mine --
highway billboard
<|endoftext|>

snow flurries --
my unborn granddaughter's
heartbeat
<|endoftext|>

gale winds
the stone Buddha
remains centered
<|endoftext|>

night watch
in the sheperds eyes
a flock of stars
<|endoftext|>

Seafood tank,
Lobsters move slowly,
Far from Maine.
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened
<|endoftext|>

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side
<|endoftext|>

rabbit and the hawk -
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red
<|endoftext|>

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky
<|endoftext|>

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek
<|endoftext|>

wolf call
in the distance ...
ice moon
<|endoftext|>

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below
<|endoftext|>

late again-
the lights change
in the evening puddle
<|endoftext|>

shortest day
three geezers paint
the pub's front green
<|endoftext|>

steam train...
just over the wall
a winter-flowering cherry
<|endoftext|>

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall
<|endoftext|>

autumn gale
a month's mortgage payments
scatter the lawn
<|endoftext|>

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the pony's back
<|endoftext|>

hunter's moon
the old tabby
refuses to come in
<|endoftext|>

in a shoebox
all the candles
of uncelebrated birthdays
<|endoftext|>

new moon -- 
forgetting
old acquaintances
<|endoftext|>

the blank page
learning nothing
from the pine
<|endoftext|>

abandoned playground --
the graffiti
fades 
<|endoftext|>

first date --
trying not to talk
to her cleavage
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon --
the dog sleeps
with one eye open
<|endoftext|>

dusting off
the Christmas lights --
gibbous moon
<|endoftext|>

cold coffee --
the crunch of a Christmas ball
under foot
<|endoftext|>

long night
the waterfall's
icy silence
<|endoftext|>

the bent nail
where garlic hung . . .
winter moon
<|endoftext|>

Dead robin -- 
its breast still
burning red.
<|endoftext|>

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill
<|endoftext|>

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light
<|endoftext|>

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution
<|endoftext|>

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea 
<|endoftext|>

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there
<|endoftext|>

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon
<|endoftext|>

the river streaks pell-mell
on either side of Eel Pie Island
two pied wagtails
<|endoftext|>

at Hampton Court
the river rises
to medieval levels...
<|endoftext|>

the forecast rain...
a queue-jumper gets berated
by everyone
<|endoftext|>

bark beetles
in the Ponderosa pine
these gnawing doubts
<|endoftext|>

New sheets.
I remember
your hands.
<|endoftext|>

cold sunshine
the stray orange cat
tucked into itself
<|endoftext|>

sleety rain
flowered umbrellas
sold out
<|endoftext|>

mid-winter thaw --
an unscratched
lottery ticket
<|endoftext|>

crowded train --
a clash
of perfumes
<|endoftext|>

the therapist says nothing
I haven't told myself -
rainless clouds
<|endoftext|>

late night at the airport
the shoe shine man
polishes his own shoes
<|endoftext|>

Buenos Aires tango
at the end of an alley
the Big Dipper
<|endoftext|>

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep
<|endoftext|>

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide
<|endoftext|>

another way out ...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

yellow moon
a glimpse of a porpoise
easing upstream
<|endoftext|>

apple slices-
our last words
in the knife's blade
<|endoftext|>

empty terminal --
headline news
for ghosts
<|endoftext|>

wolf moon --
the sway
of her hips
<|endoftext|>

winter temptation--
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes
<|endoftext|>

Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate
<|endoftext|>

a touch 
of bluegrass ...
spring 
<|endoftext|>

winter storm watch --
beware of falling
stock prices
<|endoftext|>

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee
<|endoftext|>

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain
<|endoftext|>

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow ...
hot cocoa
<|endoftext|>

cutting flowers ...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space
<|endoftext|>

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book
<|endoftext|>

almost spring
outside the embassy
plaque polishing
<|endoftext|>

for seconds between
flood rains: the sunny colours
of market mangoes
<|endoftext|>

like scattering tacks:
the forecast record rainfall
on the bus's roof
<|endoftext|>

a butterfly
over the bouquets...
I tune out the speaker
<|endoftext|>

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's
eerie silence
<|endoftext|>

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat
<|endoftext|>

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest
<|endoftext|>

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon
<|endoftext|>

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl
<|endoftext|>

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table
<|endoftext|>

brewing storm ...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee
<|endoftext|>

offshoring jobs...
the last glow of sunset
at the horizon
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice --
the Persian cat's half-
closed eyes
<|endoftext|>

endless winter
more soft snow as we await
a new grandchild
<|endoftext|>

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight
<|endoftext|>

conformation
the steady drip...drip...drip...drip...
of maple sap
<|endoftext|>

huddled cows
their steam thickens
the valley mist 
<|endoftext|>

after the storm
the wind chimes
realigning
<|endoftext|>

riding down the escalator
the scent of snow
on damp coats
<|endoftext|>

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back
<|endoftext|>

Mardi Gras -
burd-brods
thrang
<|endoftext|>

Sunday brunch
his eyes on the crumb
kissing her cleavage
<|endoftext|>

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop
<|endoftext|>

almost spring
her pink scarf taken
by the wind
<|endoftext|>

Sunday best
his overalls
washed and ironed
<|endoftext|>

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide
<|endoftext|>

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox
<|endoftext|>

street of cafes:
cherry blossom gusts
across the tables
<|endoftext|>

hail on the train-
a young woman's leg
straddles her boyfriend's
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon --
the fullness
of her hips
<|endoftext|>

still pond --
koi swim
through the sky
<|endoftext|>

tempest in a teapot --
my mother
serves me decaf
<|endoftext|>

equinox --
an 18-wheeler crossing
the double yellow line
<|endoftext|>

equinox --
splitting
the last of the wine
<|endoftext|>

still wandering
the empty corridor --
cheap perfume
<|endoftext|>

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind . . .
elsewhere
<|endoftext|>

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest
<|endoftext|>

elevator
an ex's scent
hanging
<|endoftext|>

just passing through . . .
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind
<|endoftext|>

at either end
of the twelve-carriage platform:
spring mist
<|endoftext|>

morning mist --
the fragrance
of strong coffee
<|endoftext|>

bitter wine --
time for that conversation
about Mom
<|endoftext|>

the old oak tree
where we first kissed
marked with an "X"
<|endoftext|>

new photos
of my granddaughter --
crocuses in bloom
<|endoftext|>

twilight --
she tells me she has
a spare toothbrush
<|endoftext|>

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails
<|endoftext|>

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber
<|endoftext|>

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath
<|endoftext|>

new leaves
the same old face
in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

tornado watch --
now available
in HD
<|endoftext|>

my daughter's birthday --
a child's balloon
above the clouds
<|endoftext|>

spring mist --
my granddaughter cries
in my arms
<|endoftext|>

Patriot's Day --
a homeless veteran's
weathered sign
<|endoftext|>

dusk --
that song
still makes me cry
<|endoftext|>

Holy Week --
three bare trees
against a gray sky
<|endoftext|>

Brittle scent
of a summer storm
lightning's sillage
<|endoftext|>

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be
<|endoftext|>

class reunion
an old friend's glance
at my name tag
<|endoftext|>

kite shop -
entering with every customer
the summer breeze
<|endoftext|>

lupine pools
another memory stirs
my nostalgia
<|endoftext|>

globe lilies
an empty place
at the supper table
<|endoftext|>

heat wave
the cat opens one eye
halfway
<|endoftext|>

early stars
the weed-choked path
to the compost
<|endoftext|>

haiku potato chips
nobody can write
just one
<|endoftext|>

crushed shell
in the morning light
the snail's last movements
<|endoftext|>

deep fog
i wish i had another
cup of tea
<|endoftext|>

blurry stars
the jasmine bloom
fills the air
<|endoftext|>

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone
<|endoftext|>

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag
<|endoftext|>

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain
<|endoftext|>

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web
<|endoftext|>

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic & earth
<|endoftext|>

flash of lightning
the salesman's oily manner
slips
<|endoftext|>

bleached driftwood
the sand on the floor migrates
to the dustpan
<|endoftext|>

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light
<|endoftext|>

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku
<|endoftext|>

Canada Day
this country and I
aging together
<|endoftext|>

ocean playground
the way memories come and go
with the tide
<|endoftext|>

rail track
amidst the corn fields
bisected infinity
<|endoftext|>

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire & roses
<|endoftext|>

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac
<|endoftext|>

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies
<|endoftext|>

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog
<|endoftext|>

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e
<|endoftext|>

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase
<|endoftext|>

last light
on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp
<|endoftext|>

summer clouds --
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti
<|endoftext|>

picnic -
butterflies and
flies in the butter
<|endoftext|>

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope
<|endoftext|>

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier
<|endoftext|>

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze
<|endoftext|>

sun's rise
the voices of crows
lift it higher
<|endoftext|>

coming home . . .
the scent of the ocean
before the sound
<|endoftext|>

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers
<|endoftext|>

open jalousies
the missing scent
of his cologne
<|endoftext|>

wine moon
the heat in the kitchen
so close
<|endoftext|>

starless night
the cyclist
without lights
<|endoftext|>

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.
<|endoftext|>

clear vause o roses -
deep in the watter
muckle breers
<|endoftext|>

labor day
and still
no labor
<|endoftext|>

a chill ~
just before the drizzle
wind chime notes
<|endoftext|>

awake
in the dark
the darkness
<|endoftext|>

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly
<|endoftext|>

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night
<|endoftext|>

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose
<|endoftext|>

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall
<|endoftext|>

as old as I feel
on a gray morning . . .
autumn equinox
<|endoftext|>

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight
<|endoftext|>

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift
<|endoftext|>

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight
<|endoftext|>

tai chi
slicing the morning mist
in quarters
<|endoftext|>

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train
<|endoftext|>

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels
<|endoftext|>

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill -
the silence
of the bee hive
<|endoftext|>

cloudy skies -
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower
<|endoftext|>

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn
<|endoftext|>

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard
<|endoftext|>

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall
<|endoftext|>

morning fog --
an empty
tequila bottle
<|endoftext|>

asleep
on the subway floor
the unknown soldier
<|endoftext|>

Veteran's Day --
the old dog's
gray muzzle
<|endoftext|>

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer
<|endoftext|>

apple core
how to bottle
memories
<|endoftext|>

lee of the storm
the jagged edges
of the new pothole
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving night --
an empty parking lot
at the nursing home
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving rain --
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog
<|endoftext|>

Thanksgiving rain --
the dog
no one wanted
<|endoftext|>

alone at the bar
the missing letters
in a neon light
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
the doctor schedules
a biopsy
<|endoftext|>

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist
<|endoftext|>

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death
<|endoftext|>

bad beer --
the stock market
goes flat
<|endoftext|>

mixed precipitation --
she tells me I look good
for my age
<|endoftext|>

enlightment --
a police car
on fire
<|endoftext|>

late night date
sand in her bra
all day long
<|endoftext|>

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room
<|endoftext|>

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed
<|endoftext|>

laundry day --
the search
for matching socks
<|endoftext|>

Christmas leftovers --
my mother forgets
why she called
<|endoftext|>

the sudden chill--
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape
<|endoftext|>

fresh snow
beginning the new year
with a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

first morning
the marks of a moth
in old laundry
<|endoftext|>

a lamb's cry
scudding clouds over
the cemetery wall
<|endoftext|>

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve
<|endoftext|>

My 72nd winter
the deepening cold
in every room 
<|endoftext|>

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet
<|endoftext|>

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles
<|endoftext|>

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another
<|endoftext|>

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane
<|endoftext|>

all I need are mountains
and a hedgehog -
autumn deepens
<|endoftext|>

wild wind
on dry sedge--
what more on her mind? 
<|endoftext|>

mixed precipitation --
a flat finish
on Wall Street
<|endoftext|>

a long meeting --
permanent marker
on the erasble whiteboard
<|endoftext|>

sipping absinthe
the impressionist painting
of night
<|endoftext|>

urban incense --
a steaming
manhole cover
<|endoftext|>

sailing the seas
of my subconscious --
her fishnet stockings
<|endoftext|>

cold snap --
the junkyard dog's
heavy chain
<|endoftext|>

wolf moon --
suddenly I see her
in a different light
<|endoftext|>

hail storm
rearranging gravel
in the Zen garden
<|endoftext|>

winter rain --
a flowered umbrella
at the funeral
<|endoftext|>

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

all the birds
unnamed on the fence
spring rain
<|endoftext|>

sleep disorder
the gas station lights
keep me company
<|endoftext|>

the half-truths
in a well-lit room
midnight's rain
<|endoftext|>

the cold cry
of a magpie?
first light of day
<|endoftext|>

winter driving
almost blinded
by a sun-dog
<|endoftext|>

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels
<|endoftext|>

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine
<|endoftext|>

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems
<|endoftext|>

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples ...
orchard fog
<|endoftext|>

drifting jet trails
half a haiku searches
for enlightenment
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes
<|endoftext|>

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid
<|endoftext|>

spring cleaning
long neglected baseball cards
see the light of day
<|endoftext|>

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds
<|endoftext|>

after the storm
the streets
have no names
<|endoftext|>

early autumn --
the golden highlights
in her green hair
<|endoftext|>

bus stop-
the winter dance
of cold feet
<|endoftext|>

scent of rain
all the ways
we failed each other
<|endoftext|>

cherry trees
fifty shades
of pink
<|endoftext|>

winter roses
I am tired of reading
between the lines
<|endoftext|>

mudslide
the last rain of 2005
segues into '06
<|endoftext|>

new year's balloons -
the pregnant woman
staring at the mirror
<|endoftext|>

cloudy sunset -
a lone traffic light
turns red
<|endoftext|>

first snow . . .
next to the new calendar
a clean slate
<|endoftext|>

new widescreen tv:
watching junk in
high definition
<|endoftext|>

scrabble dictionary--
lighting one candle
from another
<|endoftext|>

Friday the 13th --
a bit of volcanic ash
in the winter fog
<|endoftext|>

night of stars
in the next room
my sick mother
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice --
the fog lifts from a tree
filled with ravens
<|endoftext|>

closing time --
an expensive fingernail
on the mall floor
<|endoftext|>

january freeze--
koi chase each other
above the television
<|endoftext|>

groundhog day...
sharing a sausage
with friends
<|endoftext|>

autumn seabreeze...
a film of salt forms
on his glasses
<|endoftext|>

grey morning...
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog
<|endoftext|>

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree...
white snow cover
<|endoftext|>

migrating swallows
she tells me
she'll pray for me
<|endoftext|>

things come and go <>
raindrops
on the pine
<|endoftext|>

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark <>
snow, snow, snow
<|endoftext|>

breezy afternoon
  running my hands
  across the cool sheets
<|endoftext|>

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn
<|endoftext|>

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses
<|endoftext|>

biting cold --
frost on the nail heads
of the old fence
<|endoftext|>

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground
<|endoftext|>

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh--
february rains
<|endoftext|>

high tide--
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon -
she is cutting her nails
in the garden
<|endoftext|>

meditating and 
resplendent in sunlight--
she finally swats the fly
<|endoftext|>

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent
<|endoftext|>

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence
<|endoftext|>

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day --
International Women's Day
<|endoftext|>

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow
<|endoftext|>

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm
<|endoftext|>

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
a man standing outside
the bus shelter
<|endoftext|>

snowflakes
a robin's flight
from tree to tree
<|endoftext|>

she tucks the sonogram photo --
back in her wallet
spring sun
<|endoftext|>

moon hare-
bloody gloves lay
on the ice
<|endoftext|>

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field...
journey's end.
<|endoftext|>

24 hour store -
jacaranda flowers fall 
day & night
<|endoftext|>

morning sun -
the long shadows
of little stones
<|endoftext|>

the barn doors open--
dry leaves sweep
into the muddy yard
<|endoftext|>

first spring snow
I release my soul in
my first yoga class
<|endoftext|>

porn shop--
each cock
stares at her
<|endoftext|>

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts
<|endoftext|>

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall
<|endoftext|>

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you
<|endoftext|>

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top, the cat
<|endoftext|>

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound --
making my bed
<|endoftext|>

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu
<|endoftext|>

Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday
<|endoftext|>

In the early morning
down on the white beach --
a turtle without eyes
<|endoftext|>

spring
full moon
new roses
<|endoftext|>

instant message--
moon reveals more
of herself each night
<|endoftext|>

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits
<|endoftext|>

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog
<|endoftext|>

high tide
yesterday's footprints
gone
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus
<|endoftext|>

customs' declaration -
determining the value
of new haiku
<|endoftext|>

spring day-
the wall clock
still winter
<|endoftext|>

appalachian spring-
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light
<|endoftext|>

subway window -
she smiles at
my reflection
<|endoftext|>

alone again -
one plane flies to south
another to north
<|endoftext|>

looking at her
childhood photos
my girlfriend older than me
<|endoftext|>

first light
broken blue shell
under the maple
<|endoftext|>

tea party over
lipstick 
smiles remain
<|endoftext|>

evening thunder--
robin calls echo
across the park
<|endoftext|>

Late night jazz
the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe
<|endoftext|>

midnight.
the stallion's single kick
against the wall
<|endoftext|>

quiet stable...
the sudden force
of horse piss
<|endoftext|>

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce
<|endoftext|>

dust--
distant thunder
moves on
<|endoftext|>

cloudy day -
the rainbow flag waves
on a balcony
<|endoftext|>

bus stop -
a woman's perfume
in the air
<|endoftext|>

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up
<|endoftext|>

spring morning
those young men have noticed 
what she's not wearing
<|endoftext|>

old western --
black hats white hats 
in shades of gray
<|endoftext|>

cinco de mayo--
I walk downhill to watch
the moon rise again
<|endoftext|>

spring storm--
overripe bananas
in the kitchen
<|endoftext|>

spring morning
flies return
to a crab carcass
<|endoftext|>

almost summer . . .
eating an especially
ripe mango
<|endoftext|>

terminal . . . 
his favorite ice cream 
melts in the cup
<|endoftext|>

new snow
I almost forget
our quarrel
<|endoftext|>

early spring . . .
young women collecting
peach blossoms
<|endoftext|>

after midnight . . .
a shooting star beneath
the wharf
<|endoftext|>

mid-summer . . .
she shares with me
a ripe melon!
<|endoftext|>

no longer a
mirror, this lake chasing
geese into darkness
<|endoftext|>

at the cottage . . .
last year's mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall
<|endoftext|>

spring cleaning . . .
painting over
last year's mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>

three petals fall
from the purple coneflower...
almost summer
<|endoftext|>

a boy and his dad
playing catch out back . . .
long shadows
<|endoftext|>

main street-
ribbons that used to be
yellow
<|endoftext|>

arguing downstairs --
she shuts the windows
in her doll house
<|endoftext|>

ebb tide-
they suddenly have
cold feet
<|endoftext|>

bonfire smoke
we talk about
our disappointments
<|endoftext|>

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home
<|endoftext|>

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase
<|endoftext|>

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer
<|endoftext|>

fooneral Mass -
in the bicker
a deid flee
<|endoftext|>

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylark's song
<|endoftext|>

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring
<|endoftext|>

haiku group
the discussion stops
for a robin
<|endoftext|>

hurkle-bane surgery -
on the wa
Degas' ballerinas
<|endoftext|>

lazy rain
the solitary blackbird's
dawn chorus
<|endoftext|>

snowmelt . . .
my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking
<|endoftext|>

midnight rain?
now every minute
the grass, greening
<|endoftext|>

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear
<|endoftext|>

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls
<|endoftext|>

the last of the boxes
finally moved out
cloud covered sunset
<|endoftext|>

handing off the keys
a chill wind hustles
the end of April
<|endoftext|>

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning
<|endoftext|>

a vause
o wullflooers
lichtenin the kirk
<|endoftext|>

day long weeding
the last dandelion
under my bench
<|endoftext|>

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar
<|endoftext|>

winter sun
the slow drip-drip
of an icicle
<|endoftext|>

starry night
a million words
unspoken
<|endoftext|>

children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed
<|endoftext|>

her obituary . . .
the things we did
that summer
<|endoftext|>

imagine
a field of dandelion fluffs
before the wind
<|endoftext|>

house renovation -
the magic mushrooms
he hid 25 years ago
<|endoftext|>

ghost town -- 
a rooster crows
for no reason at all
<|endoftext|>

end of the road --
three big dogs
with nothing to do
<|endoftext|>

an oasis
in the Bible Belt --
adult book store
<|endoftext|>

jasmine
beneath the stars
his blue eyes
<|endoftext|>

wine sapped moon
the distance beyond
her lover's wife
<|endoftext|>

ferocious storms
wakened by the wet
of a dog tongue
<|endoftext|>

dark news
the comfort
of crows
<|endoftext|>

sunny spell
so sensual the necks
of daffodils
<|endoftext|>

how can he love so much?
warm evening light
on the waving dog's tail
<|endoftext|>

two swans
the progress
of twilight
<|endoftext|>

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars
<|endoftext|>

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze
<|endoftext|>

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began
<|endoftext|>

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows
<|endoftext|>

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals
<|endoftext|>

winter sunlight
on rumpled linen
those slow hands
<|endoftext|>

clothes dried on the line-
a spring morning
still in the folds
<|endoftext|>

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth
<|endoftext|>

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries
<|endoftext|>

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand
<|endoftext|>

craw an leprone
flee aff
tae cum yin
<|endoftext|>

anti social behaviour -
all night the wind
kicks a can around
<|endoftext|>

starless night --
I can't believe
the weekend is over
<|endoftext|>

after the rain
a puddle filled
with stars
<|endoftext|>

abandoned school --
a soft breeze ripples
through the weeds
<|endoftext|>

after the conference
pigeons feasting
on crumbs
<|endoftext|>

still pond --
a dragonfly lands
on the moon
<|endoftext|>

severe thunderstorm warning --
a murder
of crows 
<|endoftext|>

daylight fades --
my mother asks
the same question twice
<|endoftext|>

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze
<|endoftext|>

amid war
and rumors of war. . .
another grandchild
<|endoftext|>

her black hair
veils our praying hands ...
hospice church at dusk
<|endoftext|>

twilight moon --
a hole in the chestnut
fills with stars
<|endoftext|>

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice
<|endoftext|>

unexpected guest-
a thought came out
of nowhere
<|endoftext|>

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave
<|endoftext|>

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars
<|endoftext|>

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight
<|endoftext|>

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky & some
<|endoftext|>

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
<|endoftext|>

siller sin -
a drapt quinie
i the burn
<|endoftext|>

fifteen elephants -
after the storm
the cockerels waking
<|endoftext|>

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon
<|endoftext|>

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky
<|endoftext|>

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side
<|endoftext|>

fireworks over . . .
the silence
of the stars
<|endoftext|>

piercing stones
all along the promenade
cicadas and ringtones
<|endoftext|>

too hot to shop
wasps drinking from
a town fountain
<|endoftext|>

lit caunles
tears as they mouten -
Nagasaki day
<|endoftext|>

clematis climbing
climbing through
the climbing rose
<|endoftext|>

liggin hert tae hert
tentie
o the rackets
<|endoftext|>

Wedding Day -
in the bride's eyes
the groom's smile
<|endoftext|>

family home
the grain of the wood
enters his hands
<|endoftext|>

curly morning clouds
half round
the moon and me
<|endoftext|>

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain
<|endoftext|>

a granita before
the afternoon shift
short shadows
<|endoftext|>

two moons
somewhere between ports
she tells him it's over
<|endoftext|>

lengthening shadows
things best said
in a letter
<|endoftext|>

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks
<|endoftext|>

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars
<|endoftext|>

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond
<|endoftext|>

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot
<|endoftext|>

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener
<|endoftext|>

looking for something
in the bottom of a cup
the low autumn sun
<|endoftext|>

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
and trucks
<|endoftext|>

cold stethoscope --
I lie to the doctor
about my drinking
<|endoftext|>

hurry up
to cross the trail
reckless snail !
<|endoftext|>

mistfall
the swansongs
of orb spiders
<|endoftext|>

hard frost-
the snail-hammerings
of a song thrush
<|endoftext|>

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples
<|endoftext|>

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown
<|endoftext|>

indian simmer -
bummers'
lang sheddaes
<|endoftext|>

hazard lights
through raindrops
October leaves
<|endoftext|>

Kirkstone Pass
a sheepdog gathers
its part of the world
<|endoftext|>

tired new mom -
brown leaves
falling from the green trees
<|endoftext|>

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze --
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes
<|endoftext|>

the heat . . .
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight
<|endoftext|>

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite
<|endoftext|>

the moon
not quite full
but full enough
<|endoftext|>

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

a wasp
struggling in the web
last apples
<|endoftext|>

spring frost --
the park cannon aimed
at the church
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon --
grass gone to seed
on the tennis court
<|endoftext|>

late afternoon -
the fulness
of the cow's udder
<|endoftext|>

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower
<|endoftext|>

dead cat...
open-mouthed
to the pouring rain
<|endoftext|>

shaking the stone from her shoe -
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts
<|endoftext|>

huddled smokers --
another conversation
about The Cloud
<|endoftext|>

forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves
<|endoftext|>

a dew drop 
full 
of autumn light
<|endoftext|>

another day
another apple crumble
. . . autumn deepens
<|endoftext|>

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom
<|endoftext|>

smoke on the wind
midnight's every breath
tastes of fire
<|endoftext|>

grey autumn day
knowing when it's time
in my bones
<|endoftext|>

where trees bloom
with egrets at dusk
the quiet sky
<|endoftext|>

at the deep end
of a winter day
birdsong
<|endoftext|>

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples
<|endoftext|>

thanksgiving
my mind wanders
to my dead brother
<|endoftext|>

domestic terrorism --
winter moths
at the door
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling 
<|endoftext|>

unknowns
waiting for the wind
to cry again
<|endoftext|>

sunday eve
the blues moan softly
across the pond
<|endoftext|>

storm clouds
billowing in the wind
a stranger's coat
<|endoftext|>

deep canyon
the grand voice
of a tiny wren
<|endoftext|>

desert night
a constellation of tents
glows yellow
<|endoftext|>

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog
<|endoftext|>

christmas lights . . .
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese
<|endoftext|>

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like
<|endoftext|>

moving day
my shadow by the pond
one last time
<|endoftext|>

growth rings
a child sings her way
around a tree
<|endoftext|>

my missing pen
the cat pretends sleep
on a winter's eve
<|endoftext|>

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know
<|endoftext|>

winter park -
white wings and blue lights
flashing
<|endoftext|>

photo archive
the ice skaters' grins
frozen in time
<|endoftext|>

snow turns to rain -
wondering when
it all went wrong
<|endoftext|>

war -
fathers
burying sons
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the street sweeper picks up
a glass half full
<|endoftext|>

carousel music ?
i still see my brother
on the painted pony
<|endoftext|>

husband at work ?
the mailman knocks
to see the newborn
<|endoftext|>

just west of dawn
an earful of geese
heading south
<|endoftext|>

the grey sound
of a boat's emptiness
cold dawn rain
<|endoftext|>

on the morning side
of the river's end
rising star
<|endoftext|>

puddles of sky
a child's first step
in the clouds
<|endoftext|>

frost
on the spent firework casing
new year's day
<|endoftext|>

snow flurries -
my unborn grandchild's
perfect fingers
<|endoftext|>

stuck behind
a schoolbus -
thunderclouds
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon -
leaning her head
against my shoulder
<|endoftext|>

icy conditions -
another slide
on Wall Street
<|endoftext|>

converting to condos
the nightclub
where we met
<|endoftext|>

in a dark place
quietly fermenting
homebrew
<|endoftext|>

new moon -
time to lose
the beard
<|endoftext|>

emptying the wine bottle -
another conversation
about Mom
<|endoftext|>

my stock portfolio -
puddles filled
with winter rain
<|endoftext|>

occupying Wall Street
the ghosts
of my retirement dreams
<|endoftext|>

that recurring dream
in which I pull the fire alarm
and run
<|endoftext|>

epiphany -
Jesus and Mary
stopped at the border
<|endoftext|>

epiphany -
the gift of a dead mouse
at the door
<|endoftext|>

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war
<|endoftext|>

first thaw -
someone should have warned
the daffodils
<|endoftext|>

crow after crow
the morning darkens
with biblical rain
<|endoftext|>

honking through the darkness
long before their shapes:
the twilight geese
<|endoftext|>

steamy sex
in the church parking lot -
amazing Grace
<|endoftext|>

the pastor's daughter
her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
<|endoftext|>

after the bell
just the rain on the umbrellas
ashes to ashes
<|endoftext|>

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears
cold rain
<|endoftext|>

final approach -
she pencils in
her eyebrows
<|endoftext|>

melting snow -
an unfinished
haiku
<|endoftext|>

the Dow falls -
rose petals
in the wind
<|endoftext|>

between doses
of cough medicine
silence
<|endoftext|>

following me
downriver to work:
the pastel moon
<|endoftext|>

sharp night
a thin plume of smoke
from the fire station
<|endoftext|>

closet renovation--
removing all her clothes
she nails the carpenter
<|endoftext|>

afternoon tryst ...
thunder bangs overhead
in the sticky heat
<|endoftext|>

twilight
a cricket's 
sudden silence
<|endoftext|>

budget cuts --
a crescent moon
on the horizon
<|endoftext|>

Ash Wednesday --
a dusting
of snow
<|endoftext|>

police sirens --
another night
without the moon
<|endoftext|>

on my smartphone
mount fuji in the sunset
morning coffee ---
<|endoftext|>

between train tracks
recumbent beer bottles
beset by frost
<|endoftext|>

the line of poplars
blackens a mackerel sky...
February blues
<|endoftext|>

partly cloudy
I remember the face
but not the name
<|endoftext|>

intertwined
in my washing machine,
my daughter's bras
<|endoftext|>

whiskey moon
a morning after
at the bottles end
<|endoftext|>

a lake
brimming with mountains
trout ripple the sky
<|endoftext|>

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam
<|endoftext|>

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news
<|endoftext|>

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms
<|endoftext|>

seed catalog
the colours of
a winter daydream
<|endoftext|>

cabin walls 
feeling my way through
a wilderness night
<|endoftext|>

against my skin
the roughness of firewood
hoar frost
<|endoftext|>

my umbrella
flipped in the wind
uncertain days
<|endoftext|>

rain on the river 
when does white become
its darkest colour --
<|endoftext|>

waiting for the train
a huddled mass
of smartphones
<|endoftext|>

zazen
that fly battering itself
against the sunny window
<|endoftext|>

morning meditation -- 
a steaming
manhole cover
<|endoftext|>

winter rain --
the dog and I
exchange sighs
<|endoftext|>

asleep at the wheel
the ghost cabbie
of my nightmares
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon --
she's not telling
the whole truth
<|endoftext|>

two-hour meeting --
shadows creep
across the table
<|endoftext|>

frost on the windshield --
I remember how much
I drank last night
<|endoftext|>

leap year
looking a her twins
a squinting woman ---
<|endoftext|>

less cars
in front of the brothels
valentine's day ---
<|endoftext|>

heavy snowfall
a hawk on a fence post
almost white
<|endoftext|>

evening coffee
wisps of fog rise
from the bayou
<|endoftext|>

the lilac in bud
a cloud with storm in it
swells over the bay
<|endoftext|>

homesick
sundown just behind
the fence
<|endoftext|>

spitting seeds
into a blue sky
the old elm
<|endoftext|>

saffron smudges
in the evening sky . . . 
 birdsong
<|endoftext|>

snow flurries --
trying to remember
when I first turned gray
<|endoftext|>

secluded highway --
we turn
the radio off
<|endoftext|>

winter rain --
a birthday reminder
for a dead friend
<|endoftext|>

stopping
for the fire truck
cicadas
<|endoftext|>

sneaking out
thru' the bathroom window
steam meets fog
<|endoftext|>

first glimpse
of her mastectomy bra
winter rose
<|endoftext|>

hospice verandah ... 
a girl opens her mouth
to spring rain
<|endoftext|>

surge of the wind ...
talk of war fading
into silence
<|endoftext|>

first kiss --
behind the bookshelf
her scent lingers
<|endoftext|>

blind date
cobra tattoo rising
from her cleavage
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
my footprints in the sand
a little deeper
<|endoftext|>

almost spring
the florist waters
her sidewalk
<|endoftext|>

evening calm
pot smoke wafts up
from under the bridge
<|endoftext|>

family dinner
our teen speaks
in hashtags
<|endoftext|>

long winding road
the length
of our quarrel
<|endoftext|>

spring storm
a small blue feather
in the cats whiskers
<|endoftext|>

the bottle empty
but my head still
full of you
<|endoftext|>

bedtime story 
scribbles of rain
across the window
<|endoftext|>

subway station
ads as only light
the day after the bombs
<|endoftext|>

petals in the wind . . .
my neighbors practise
tai-chi
<|endoftext|>

between sunrise
and my bed
an owl flies home
<|endoftext|>

a dogs bark
wavers in the wind
evening shadows
<|endoftext|>

another year
those crossed out names
in my address book
<|endoftext|>

my neighbors
apricot tree is blooming
secondhand love
<|endoftext|>

overcast
the first blooms
of apricot
<|endoftext|>

on the edge
of almost too far
crushed chili pepper
<|endoftext|>

picket fence
i bury my cat
on the sunny side
<|endoftext|>

all the quiet
gone from the pond
first bullfrog
<|endoftext|>

St. Patrick's Day --
the first green buds
on the old tree
<|endoftext|>

writer's block --
heating up
the leftovers
<|endoftext|>

starless night --
I finish the wine
too quickly
<|endoftext|>

melting snow --
the nurse searches
for a pulse
<|endoftext|>

a neat pile
of all your letters
before I burn them
<|endoftext|>

crickets
in imperfect
harmony
<|endoftext|>

spring cleaning --
cropping her out
of a photograph
<|endoftext|>

news of his relapse --
how slowly
the rain falls
<|endoftext|>

moonless night --
apologies made
in the passive voice
<|endoftext|>

early bird special --
at least fifty
shades of grey
<|endoftext|>

love again
the scent of cypress
after rain
<|endoftext|>

one by one
fireflies escape my glass jar...
starry night
<|endoftext|>

the rice song
mother sang to me ...
first spring rain
<|endoftext|>

spring chill
one kitten left
without a nipple
<|endoftext|>

ripening apples
unable to button
my summer dress
<|endoftext|>

mile after mile
of corral fencing
wind in the clover
<|endoftext|>

passing cloud
her pause
before the lie
<|endoftext|>

scattered wind
fragments of conversation
drift from a pub
<|endoftext|>

spring buds
the first batch of tadpoles
in the meadow pond
<|endoftext|>

the skipping stone
all the way across . . .
end of summer
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill--
one little cricket
sings to the moon
<|endoftext|>

cooler mornings--
the honey slows down
from the spoon
<|endoftext|>

wild beaches
in winter time--
take me there
<|endoftext|>

home alone--
sound of my fork
on the pasta bowl
<|endoftext|>

alongside the train tracks--
secrets of orchids
under moonlight
<|endoftext|>

stormy weather --
a clarinet
blues afternoon
<|endoftext|>

trains approaching--
someone on a platform
reading to the moon
<|endoftext|>

Ides of March
celebrating the return
of buzzards
<|endoftext|>

day settles down
to this world of dust
evening zazen
<|endoftext|>

seeing where
that argument is headed
spring dust storm
<|endoftext|>

a long winter
bevel on the mirror
throws a rainbow
<|endoftext|>

sliding a white marble
into its matchbox
voodoo moon
<|endoftext|>

first date --
wondering if the hat
is too much
<|endoftext|>

platform 9:
through the glass roof the shapes
of swooping gulls
<|endoftext|>

from nowhere
to nowhere . . .
bridge in fog
<|endoftext|>

On a clear day
from the pulp mill
clouds appear
<|endoftext|>

From under the dock
come the Canada geese
one by one
<|endoftext|>

A day of sun
after many of rain
my dirty windows
<|endoftext|>

dirty snow
the conductor flirts
with school girls
<|endoftext|>

campfire ~
steaming pot
and shoes
<|endoftext|>

steady drizzle --
a snore from the man
on the next yoga mat
<|endoftext|>

moonless night --
a bath oil bead
melting in the rain
<|endoftext|>

winter doldrums --
the rain drips from
plastic candy canes
<|endoftext|>

half moon
mom's birthday
without mom
<|endoftext|>

a dog stares
his cataract eyes
the colour of moons
<|endoftext|>

new moon
blue shadows in grey light
and week old snow
<|endoftext|>

early winter...
he chooses to read
old soup recipes
<|endoftext|>

end of the year --
tracks along the edge
of thin ice
<|endoftext|>

full moon --
last week's snow
slips from a wire
<|endoftext|>

sunset
fisherman rests
river flows on
<|endoftext|>

spilled words
I arrange little magnets
looking for haiku
<|endoftext|>

children voices
from under the grass
concrete bunker
<|endoftext|>

white mountains
as quick as it can
train passes by
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
each day the boy's smile
wider
<|endoftext|>

six years
presents under the tree
still wrapped
<|endoftext|>

roaches, cockroaches
heroins and cracks
in pavements and minds
<|endoftext|>

black ice --
the doctor would like
to run more tests
<|endoftext|>

new moon --
the darkness
within
<|endoftext|>

a mother's vigil --
the rhythm
of the ventilator
<|endoftext|>

mezcal morning --
the church bells
out of sync
<|endoftext|>

new construction --
chopping down
my childhood
<|endoftext|>

over Monday coffee
the conversation shifts to
"The Walking Dead"
<|endoftext|>

end of the weekend --
I finished that beer
too quickly
<|endoftext|>

my retirement plan
the ripples
in a mud puddle
<|endoftext|>

under candlelight
she tells me
about her scars
<|endoftext|>

"spring sleet"
he hisses
through clenched teeth
<|endoftext|>

city lights --
the glitter
of broken glass
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
my tears fall for the nestling
the cat gifts me
<|endoftext|>

spring cold snap
my garden spade turns up
half a worm
<|endoftext|>

moving day
cottonwood seeds drift
past my window
<|endoftext|>

ripening cherries
the cardinal's wife settles
deep in the nest
<|endoftext|>

wildflowers
the many voices
of a blue jay
<|endoftext|>

around the campfire
we wait
for the milky way
<|endoftext|>

graffiti night--
all these stars
sprayed everywhere
<|endoftext|>

how else to know
the shape of the breeze
dancing blossoms
<|endoftext|>

after the cranes
the sky refills
with silence
<|endoftext|>

prairie afternoon
the grassy taste
of every breath
<|endoftext|>

outgoing tide
what sand remembers
of night
<|endoftext|>

prairie...
between heaven and earth
an eagle
<|endoftext|>

a fork in the trail
the wind takes
our old map
<|endoftext|>

a pigtailed girl
outside the cancer center
morning glories
<|endoftext|>

her nose print
on the hospice window ..
a patch of sunlight
<|endoftext|>

snow on snow 
the depth of night
in this attic
<|endoftext|>

Gaza at twilight 
crying old tears
at a new funeral
<|endoftext|>

a crows cry ...
the winter sky darkens
into the prairie
<|endoftext|>

a long line of cars
behind the hearse
migrating snow geese
<|endoftext|>

between cries
of neighbor's baby
symphony no. 9
<|endoftext|>

traveling
far away in thought ...
hospice window
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon rising ...
a tremble
in the migrant's voice
<|endoftext|>

therapy session:
winter rain on the window
deepens the silence
<|endoftext|>

a white butterfly
flitting through the stillness ...
church grave yard
<|endoftext|>

distant sirens
over the border bridge
a blood moon
<|endoftext|>

winter night
without the heat
of his company
<|endoftext|>

all the typos
in her apology
spring winds
<|endoftext|>

leaving home
a curve carved off
the moon
<|endoftext|>

Near dusk
a flash of gold
in the heron's beak
<|endoftext|>

icy pavement
unopened buds shrink and fall
from the trees
<|endoftext|>

early spring
one morning the clang of
scaffolding poles
<|endoftext|>

night shift - still
I put on some make up
to lighten my darkness
<|endoftext|>

green rimmed eye -
a glimmer of youth buried
in the fading iris
<|endoftext|>

riverside wedding 
the flower girl
picks a dandelion
<|endoftext|>

Terrassengärten . . .
from a quiet corner
the sound of a zither
<|endoftext|>

maple tree
the scars
of its healings
<|endoftext|>

seeds catalogue
in the mail
the spring in hand
<|endoftext|>

forest trail
my thoughts meander
the fragrances
<|endoftext|>

just where
creek becomes river
the rain begins
<|endoftext|>

tuning out the news
on the back porch
barn swallows
<|endoftext|>

after our quarrel
the frog resumes
his croaking
<|endoftext|>

leap day --
sitting on my suitcase
I make it fit
<|endoftext|>

after
the kite festival . . . 
stars
<|endoftext|>

poetry workshop --
men compare
fountain pens
<|endoftext|>

waiting room
ivy growing
on the outside wall
<|endoftext|>

city bound train--
a book and a suitcase
full of stars
<|endoftext|>

around the headstone
of one who died at twenty:
wind-puffed primroses
<|endoftext|>

window cleaner
the masks we wear
at the office
<|endoftext|>

dandelions . . .
two drinkers unzip
by the path
<|endoftext|>

scrunched-up clouds
a blue plastic bag
in the nettles
<|endoftext|>

drifting fog
an acquaintance
i'd rather not meet
<|endoftext|>

old friends . . .
the garden fading
into twilight
<|endoftext|>

frog by frog
the marsh erupts
with dusk
<|endoftext|>

snail's
siller runes -
tells o muinlicht
<|endoftext|>

pink moon --
a taste
of what comes next
<|endoftext|>

after the rain
my mother forgets
who I am
<|endoftext|>

crowded cafe --
the barrista misspells
my name
<|endoftext|>

from a windowless room
the ocean view
on my screensaver
<|endoftext|>

cold spring rain --
where I buried
the puppies
<|endoftext|>

the Big Dipper
rows of corn connect
farm to farm
<|endoftext|>

the snake's dead skin
left in the driveway
Mustang Cobra
<|endoftext|>

night deepening
the office secretary adjusts
her low-cut top
<|endoftext|>

sudden news
of her breast cancer...
I add
<|endoftext|>

writing haiku ...
my wine glass fills
with sunlight
<|endoftext|>

divorce talk
each sip of tea more bitter
than the last
<|endoftext|>

all day rain
the refrigerators
ommmmm
<|endoftext|>

old pond
oil slick rainbows
slip in
<|endoftext|>

sudden rain
and then I remember
Earth Day
<|endoftext|>

shouldering coals
the rattle of blue crabs
in a metal bucket
<|endoftext|>

sun blaze
the flash of chrome
outside a biker bar
<|endoftext|>

turning seventy
i walk outside to see it
the almost full moon
<|endoftext|>

industrial decay--
the dripping rust
in heavy rain
<|endoftext|>

night rain--
we jump in neon puddles
and breathe rosemary
<|endoftext|>

freight train--
the night runs out
of breath
<|endoftext|>

nighttime whoosh --
a city train
fades
<|endoftext|>

car park puddle--
i walk through
the sky
<|endoftext|>

first blossoms
three speckled eggs
in the wrens nest
<|endoftext|>

punctuating
a moonless night
the cries of geese
<|endoftext|>

concert under the stars --
a drop of sweat lost
in her décolletage
<|endoftext|>

unconcerned
with divorce rates
mating butterflies
<|endoftext|>

spring morning
one egg left
in the fridge
<|endoftext|>

memory care unit
snowflakes melting
on the window
<|endoftext|>

internet dating
a butterfly flitting
from rose to rose
<|endoftext|>

honeymoon site
grandmother revists
by herself
<|endoftext|>

stationary front --
the same haiku
I wrote yesterday
<|endoftext|>

invisible on radar
the lingering mist
between us
<|endoftext|>

thunder clouds --
he tells me how many days
he's been sober
<|endoftext|>

mussel-blue skies . . .
the cherry blossom bright
by the brick wall
<|endoftext|>

after-party
we blow out candles
to hear the stars
<|endoftext|>

her hips
sway our debate on sex
summer heat
<|endoftext|>

the cold moon... 
I recycle a dream
from my youth
<|endoftext|>

abandoned home
an old life laid to rest
among weeds and trees
<|endoftext|>

humid morning
the scent of lilacs
fills each breath
<|endoftext|>

cold, foggy night
only the echo
of a buoy's bell
<|endoftext|>

the first dusk of may
it's suddenly there
a pale orange poppy
<|endoftext|>

headlights
in the dust storm
old friends
<|endoftext|>

rainy afternoon--
hot pikelets
with butter and honey
<|endoftext|>

rearview mirror--
pelicans with sunrise
on their wings
<|endoftext|>

running home
an empty mind
full of jasmine
<|endoftext|>

field of dandelions
thousands of wishes
going unused
<|endoftext|>

night rain 
drumming on
my mind
<|endoftext|>

mothers day
she wears her best apron
to wash the dishes
<|endoftext|>

news of
an old lover's death
long into the night
<|endoftext|>

windfall apple
eye to eye with the worm
that found it first
<|endoftext|>

summer stars
she tells a lie
without blinking
<|endoftext|>

moonbeams
a clump of mushrooms
where the bird's buried
<|endoftext|>

summer haze
mother's faded notes
for dewberry jam
<|endoftext|>

husband gone-
his watch ticks it's last tock
at her garage sale
<|endoftext|>

Out of the well
By the bucket I hunt
A moon
<|endoftext|>

boyhood friends
home once again --
side by side
<|endoftext|>

sacred ground
a bumblebee tastes
every poppy
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
only the duck's cry
passes overhead
<|endoftext|>

just after midnight
sounds become heartbeats
coyote song
<|endoftext|>

honoring those who've served
by wearing camouflage
in front of the TV
<|endoftext|>

guarding
the suburban lawn
a smiling Buddha
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon --
her unfinished
tattoo
<|endoftext|>

Delta blues --
a bead of sweat
on my beer bottle
<|endoftext|>

hand in hand
white petals blossom
as we pass
<|endoftext|>

plunging a knife
into the watermelon
the heat
<|endoftext|>

end of an affair
the ligustrum tree
no longer in bloom
<|endoftext|>

alone by candlelight
thinking of that spring we met
and another spring
<|endoftext|>

spicy chicken 
this impulse to ask
if she's married
<|endoftext|>

church graveyard
a cloud of crows hover
over stone angels
<|endoftext|>

photoshopping
my wedding pictures
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

night rain--
never too old
for a lullaby
<|endoftext|>

crossroads--
a spiderweb spans
both signs
<|endoftext|>

open window
the promise
of purple clover
<|endoftext|>

half moon
only broken crackers
in the tin
<|endoftext|>

revision notes
brushing sand
into the gaps
<|endoftext|>

pointing
every which way
cut tulips
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice . . .
the reverse side
of the needlepoint
<|endoftext|>

quietly joining
the conversation . . .
prairie stars
<|endoftext|>

painted clouds . . .
the pause before
answering "fine"
<|endoftext|>

in and out
of the rusted shed
moonshine
<|endoftext|>

dusk
the old gate sags
into its shadow
<|endoftext|>

easing into
a glass of Merlot
moonlight through the pines
<|endoftext|>

cloud with thunder
the way he says
"whatever"
<|endoftext|>

approaching storm
the silence
between us
<|endoftext|>

seniors dance
the occasional rush
of cologne
<|endoftext|>

lullabies
of suburban
night trains
<|endoftext|>

steady drizzle--
a rainbow fades
into the grey
<|endoftext|>

above the oil refinery
moon sails
seaward
<|endoftext|>

dark early--
sepia roses
under street lights
<|endoftext|>

storm watch
scars ive learned
to love
<|endoftext|>

after the stroke
only half
a smile
<|endoftext|>

spent candle
reading the last page
by first light
<|endoftext|>

restless dreams
but there you are
morning sky
<|endoftext|>

in the rubble
of my childhood home
wild flowers
<|endoftext|>

in the hospice
an out of tune piano helps
her sing without words
<|endoftext|>

after surgery
both of us said nothing...
her red bra
<|endoftext|>

a new moon --
mother's letter heavy
with voices from the past
<|endoftext|>

stonehenge
scent of lemon
from the hotel soap
<|endoftext|>

light breeze
the desire of my skin
for touch
<|endoftext|>

eyelids closed
window open
whatever story
<|endoftext|>

shadows. a window ledge
just big enough to hold
two doves
<|endoftext|>

sparks
in the heat of blue
dragonflies
<|endoftext|>

ruined stadium -
all that remains
are bird songs
<|endoftext|>

long day -
a warm breeze carries
the smell of the brewery
<|endoftext|>

a day
at the beach
June 6
<|endoftext|>

old teahouse --
a swear word from
the green parrot
<|endoftext|>

good news
the headlines blurred
in morning rain
<|endoftext|>

almost dawn . . .
thoughts of you
when we were us
<|endoftext|>

biker couple
covering their tattoos
with sunscreen
<|endoftext|>

ocean view --
the old dog
on a leash
<|endoftext|>

empty ferris wheel --
the last time
we kissed
<|endoftext|>

crossing the border
without a passport --
great blue heron
<|endoftext|>

strawberry moon --
the ribbon
in my granddaughter's hair
<|endoftext|>

another meeting
swallowing
my cold coffee
<|endoftext|>

heat lightning
the first drop of sweat
on her chin
<|endoftext|>

ripened tomatoes
the last colour
of sunset
<|endoftext|>

leaden sky
the weight
of the dead sparrow
<|endoftext|>

a whispering
among my kinfolk
wind in the cypresses
<|endoftext|>

sultry afternoon
wood pigeons cooing
from the shade
<|endoftext|>

summer night love
whatever the neighbors
are cooking
<|endoftext|>

summer solstice
the sun reaches the cobwebs
in the corner
<|endoftext|>

200 miles . . .
this plum blossom
on my windshield
<|endoftext|>

wild poppies
gusts of music from
the midsummer fair
<|endoftext|>

cold night--
not one silver track
on the footpath
<|endoftext|>

high sun -
his daughter
on his shoulders
<|endoftext|>

dinner at sunset
rainbow bubbles
on the koi pond
<|endoftext|>

neighbors shouting
from the wild grapes
multiple bird calls
<|endoftext|>

rainbow flags ...
the haunting sounds
of amazing grace
<|endoftext|>

another tragedy . . 
evening curls quietly
in the pond
<|endoftext|>

summer firelight
the memory of a dog
nuzzles my hand
<|endoftext|>

for a moment
the heat is so cold
deep south
<|endoftext|>

days o weet -
snail-pooer
on the muive
<|endoftext|>

the coastal road...
spinnakers fill
with sunset
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorm --
a late-night
visitor
<|endoftext|>

overcast night --
the mouse trap
snaps
<|endoftext|>

summer rain --
the garden gnome's
weary smile
<|endoftext|>

threatening sky --
the hum
of a power line
<|endoftext|>

even the memory
of winter is melted . . .
blazing summer day
<|endoftext|>

empty lot . . .
and still those tulips
where once was a garden
<|endoftext|>

dusty seashell
the words he whispered
in my ear
<|endoftext|>

ripened tomatoes
the busy shadow
of my straw hat
<|endoftext|>

no sound
from a crow's gaping beak...
sultry afternoon
<|endoftext|>

beach vacation
every night between the sheets
a little more sand
<|endoftext|>

between downpours
orchestral swell through
a half open window
<|endoftext|>

through a wine glass
the swaying of
feathery grass heads
<|endoftext|>

eighty-third birthday
I read the directions
one more time
<|endoftext|>

a fish breaks
the river's calm
heat haze
<|endoftext|>

lost in thought
the sound of wavelets 
at the edges
<|endoftext|>

pond of dust
a butterfly's quest
for a flower
<|endoftext|>

troubled times
the grace of sunset
on a summer day
<|endoftext|>

a whiff
of distant Coppertone
 sea breeze
<|endoftext|>

writing I love you
in the pollen dust
on her windshield
<|endoftext|>

hay moon --
the farmer's daughter
in heels
<|endoftext|>

the enlightened man
wearing lipstick
on his collar
<|endoftext|>

starless night --
the deep croak
of a bullfrog
<|endoftext|>

the scent
of sun and rain
first summer peach
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorm
so longing
for you
<|endoftext|>

oolong
pekoe
tasting each sound
<|endoftext|>

homesick
a hot wind rattles
the cottonwood leaves
<|endoftext|>

lilac shadows
scale the garden wall;
slip off into the woods
<|endoftext|>

the sound of heat
everything is
cicadas
<|endoftext|>

as still as midnight
hanging in the moss
the dying moth
<|endoftext|>

passing storm
bits of sky settle
in the treetops
<|endoftext|>

crowded train --
the bright red glare
of her lipstick
<|endoftext|>

anniversary
a few weeds
in the rose bed
<|endoftext|>

summer winds 
pieces of moon
through the willow
<|endoftext|>

long afternoon
the occasional tapping
of a screen door
<|endoftext|>

a butterfly
tattooed on her buttock
summer heat
<|endoftext|>

walking the old path
in secondhand shoes
new moon
<|endoftext|>

rain on the bayou
just enough moon
to silver the ripples
<|endoftext|>

first notes
of a busker's clarinet...
summer river
<|endoftext|>

autumn chill
replacing the battery
in my mouse
<|endoftext|>

after the rainstorm
last drops from the roof
heighten the silence
<|endoftext|>

the time it takes to learn
how to be silent
blue mountains
<|endoftext|>

between Cassiopeia
and me -
fireworks!
<|endoftext|>

freight train night--
the restless
dreams
<|endoftext|>

lone guest gone 
the ticking 
of the parlor clock
<|endoftext|>

in the darkening yard,
the sun strikes 
the cockscombs red
<|endoftext|>

between the treetops
and bright stars 
puffs of white clouds drift
<|endoftext|>

late night
with Ryokan 
I warm the rice wine
<|endoftext|>

held together
by its label 
a crushed whiskey bottle
<|endoftext|>

whatever the weather,
his soft smile  
the buddha in the garden
<|endoftext|>

worn in places
to the bare wood 
the golden buddha
<|endoftext|>

travelers still catch
the Greyhound there 
the boarded up diner
<|endoftext|>

rain at graveside 
mourning clothes
soaked a deeper hue
<|endoftext|>

after the burial 
a day moon
rising
<|endoftext|>

he looks perplexed -
the scarecrow,
chest deep in the river's flood
<|endoftext|>

zazen -
the hum
of the Fridgidaire
<|endoftext|>

bridge night -
trying to remember
our last passionate kiss
<|endoftext|>

flag ceremony -
the old vet's uniform
hangs loosely
<|endoftext|>

another flood
a different voice
in the bayou
<|endoftext|>

on his third try
the fish hawk wins
summer games
<|endoftext|>

only a fish
nibbling a lily pad
morning fog
<|endoftext|>

dry thunder
on the tip of my tongue
the scent of rain
<|endoftext|>

ripe wheat fields
listening to the swoosh, swoosh
as rain clouds approach
<|endoftext|>

sunrise
on the bayou
water lilies
<|endoftext|>

summer twilight --
the instructions
for my ashes
<|endoftext|>

blood-tinted soil
where the sugar plantation
used to be
<|endoftext|>

faint pencil marks
on the wall --
her dead child's room
<|endoftext|>

the smell
of summer heat ...
roadkill 
<|endoftext|>

foreclosure sign
in its shadow
a dollhouse
<|endoftext|>

one by one
frogs make holes in the pond ...
starry night
<|endoftext|>

vacant lot overgrown
with queen annes lace
and car parts
<|endoftext|>

garden stones
pearled by wind and rain
indian summer
<|endoftext|>

mountain thunder
the birds change
their tune
<|endoftext|>

Orion rises
dragging Autumn behind him
Late August morning
<|endoftext|>

roman road
I carry the dust
further north
<|endoftext|>

to paint a graveyard
grey again
autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

piece
of a butterfly wing 
autumn chill
<|endoftext|>

a crow
on the wire
silent rain
<|endoftext|>

cooking together--
a touch of cinnamon
on my lips
<|endoftext|>

foggy morning . . .
blazing with bittersweet
the cemetery wall
<|endoftext|>

leaden clouds . . .
the way the bare trees
support them
<|endoftext|>

end of summer
strands of an abandoned kite
flutter in the wind
<|endoftext|>

lengthening days
even the morning glory
a shade bluer
<|endoftext|>

sweet peas
sclimin
the jyle palin
<|endoftext|>

summer haze --
someone murmurs
"Alzheimer's"
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon --
her updated
relationship status
<|endoftext|>

a latch clicks
on the vacant house ...
winter solstice
<|endoftext|>

first day of spring
the lingering scent
of rare books
<|endoftext|>

edge of the woods
some things I may not want
to know
<|endoftext|>

end of summer
we no longer know
what sleeps in the barn
<|endoftext|>

valley wedding
the scent of gun smoke
coming uphill
<|endoftext|>

nobody's tree
on the highest branch
the perfect apples
<|endoftext|>

moon silence
the sound of a mouse
comes between us
<|endoftext|>

Standing silently 
In autumn rain
The old cypress
<|endoftext|>

fifty years
of letters & journals
flash flood
<|endoftext|>

summer night
somewhere a saxophone
on born to run
<|endoftext|>

wildflower bouquet
taking the ladybug
back outside
<|endoftext|>

sultry day -
the tumult of rain
on my umbrella
<|endoftext|>

a hole in the meadow -
lowering
the farmer's body
<|endoftext|>

park bench
she puts acorns
in his ears
<|endoftext|>

supermarket
on a Sunday morning
Stairway to Heaven
<|endoftext|>

roadside
a strip of painkillers
empty
<|endoftext|>

before the bridal party
unfashionably early
rain arrives
<|endoftext|>

a crack
in the pavement
yellow freesias
<|endoftext|>

sun rising
suddenly the sumac
bursts into flame
<|endoftext|>

climbing the walls
of the disused youth club:
flowering hops
<|endoftext|>

summer storm
the windscreen wipers
slice our silence
<|endoftext|>

fireworks show
the migrant speaks of the home
he left behind
<|endoftext|>

whale sighting--
all the smart phones
lined up on the deck
<|endoftext|>

late summer -
copper wishes collect
in the bottom of the well
<|endoftext|>

Indian summer
the sweeping can wait
for another day
<|endoftext|>

off the trail,
on the trail,
grasshopper...
<|endoftext|>

farm auction-
fields filled with goldenrods
and asters
<|endoftext|>

troubled sleep --
sparks
from a high-tension wire
<|endoftext|>

early autumn
a round orange leaf
curled on the pavement
<|endoftext|>

sunday morning
the jasmine climbs
a cloud higher
<|endoftext|>

night bus stop
the plop of a Styrofoam cup
and swirl of coffee
<|endoftext|>

a love letter
in mother's handwriting... 
asters gone to seed
<|endoftext|>

Patient old donkey
waiting for her morning hay
Gray August sunrise
<|endoftext|>

this spring's fragrance
were it a woman I'd
follow wherever
<|endoftext|>

his eyes
watching their eyes
watching her
<|endoftext|>

drizzle this morning
islands drowned in the mist
red lights of the bridge
<|endoftext|>

somewhere
in the autumn haze
cranes calling
<|endoftext|>

traffic jam -
a crow flutters in the place
over the bridge
<|endoftext|>

city peak hour -
happily lost
in sunset sky art
<|endoftext|>

in the far shadows
something swimming
-- or a log
<|endoftext|>

An orange and pink sky -
from the pulpmill a grey cloud
on the cool Spring day
<|endoftext|>

Grey and blue Spring morning
the lumber mill making clouds
my first cup of Melitta
<|endoftext|>

waiting for
the loon to surface
I hold my breath
<|endoftext|>

Foggy day --
On the Verrazano
the car vanishes
<|endoftext|>

traffic lights -
just enough time
to scribble a poem
<|endoftext|>

sea mist...
watching the seal
watching me
<|endoftext|>

house for sale
the apricot tree in bloom
as never before
<|endoftext|>

full moon -
even the dilapidated barn
looks majestic
<|endoftext|>

a hint of blue, still
in the passing of these clouds
 sip of coffee
<|endoftext|>

air-raid alarm --
traffic lights are working
for no one
<|endoftext|>

her long legs ...
I walk right into
a spider web
<|endoftext|>

looking at
the mirror's reflection
is that really you ?
<|endoftext|>

At 12:01
he takes his bath
in last century's water
<|endoftext|>

night wind
the moon in a corner
of the window
<|endoftext|>

do I know you --
my young face looks ta me
from an old photo
<|endoftext|>

moonless night
dead silence but for
one cricket
<|endoftext|>

march sunshine
the distant call
of a robin
<|endoftext|>

evening mist
in the distance
a yelping
<|endoftext|>

mountain cabin --
the voices of people hidden
by the night
<|endoftext|>

leading deeper
into the woods
just birdsong
<|endoftext|>

in the mist
the sound of the brook
more silent
<|endoftext|>

gathering dusk --
with each swell of sea
a buoy dips deeper
<|endoftext|>

her face
in my whiisky
the moon floats
<|endoftext|>

morning run
observing me at the observatory
the fox
<|endoftext|>

crow and I
scanning yards for signs of life
eye at each other
<|endoftext|>

endless rain
without opening
a crocus falls
<|endoftext|>

evening bus
this man in the reflection
is it me?
<|endoftext|>

roadside puddle
a street dog licks
the winter moon
<|endoftext|>

after bombing
ruins of the bridge
linked by fog
<|endoftext|>

impenetrable haze --
the other side
of the bridge
<|endoftext|>

at the top of the fence
morning glories
climbing air
<|endoftext|>

mist trailing
over the autumn fields . . .
a raven's cry
<|endoftext|>

hurricane watch --
the tall tree's shadow
over our house
<|endoftext|>

hunter's moon --
she asks if I've found
what I needed
<|endoftext|>

off-season --
the bartender
doesn't look up
<|endoftext|>

migrating geese --
no one asks them
where they're from
<|endoftext|>

rotten apples
we let the storm
pick them
<|endoftext|>

distant gunshots ... 
sunflower petals
fold into night
<|endoftext|>

midnight moon...
one long howl
and then no more
<|endoftext|>

"dust to dust . . . "
the widow's shadow
on the coffin
<|endoftext|>

the stare
of a newborn ...
starry night
<|endoftext|>

the click
of her red high heels ...
divorce court
<|endoftext|>

her short life
packed in an urn
smell of winter
<|endoftext|>

drifts of fog ...
first job interview
in one year
<|endoftext|>

all one can see
in her shaky handwriting
dark rain
<|endoftext|>

on each pass by
she rearranges the cut flowers
frost warning 
<|endoftext|>

late love
through dusty windows
a mellow light
<|endoftext|>

harvest moon
an owl swoops
into a cornfield
<|endoftext|>

aged brandy,
eggnog and pumpkin beer
the old wagon
<|endoftext|>

unpicked apples
we promise
to keep in touch
<|endoftext|>

indian summer
two rows of maize
left standing
<|endoftext|>

flickering street light
from darkness to darkness
the flight of a bat
<|endoftext|>

insomnia
the sound of a goose
lost in the night
<|endoftext|>

community garden
a fence separates
carrots from carrots
<|endoftext|>

abandoned farmhouse-
autumn twilight darkest
in the empty windows
<|endoftext|>

winter leaf --
how she cups the pills
in her hand
<|endoftext|>

abandoned by geese
heading south -
my autumn birthday
<|endoftext|>

wave from a kid
riding the carousel . . .
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

abandoned factory . . .
parking spaces marked
Reserved
<|endoftext|>

drying laundry 
the faded colors
of twilight
<|endoftext|>

hunting season
the maple's
blood red
<|endoftext|>

chainsaw
hearing the river flow
afterward
<|endoftext|>

becoming dusk
rooftop to treetop,
the echo of crows
<|endoftext|>

summer solstice
unrolling dust
with the blinds
<|endoftext|>

just beyond
the candle's reach . . .
fireflies
<|endoftext|>

the lonely feeling
of dylan's harmonica
evening star
<|endoftext|>

down to one puddle
of moon
<|endoftext|>

before the storm

in my mothers hand

over the border town...
refugees walk

vanishes

with the world
<|endoftext|>

after harsh words
we pull our chairs
into the sun

fired

you left behind
<|endoftext|>

in the churchyard
where my father found god 
bruised apples
<|endoftext|>

forgetting his voice
my dads apology letter 
crackles in the fire
<|endoftext|>

living alone
the quiet ritual
of coffee
<|endoftext|>

after each haiku
the pencil
a little shorter
<|endoftext|>

unknotting 
the hammock ropes;
the scent of burnt leaves
<|endoftext|>

the spider hanging in its web
doesn't care
the world is upside down
<|endoftext|>

gibbous moon

growing.

under the same
October moon
<|endoftext|>

in the ruins
of a beach house

curtains flapping
in the breeze
<|endoftext|>

October moon
the shadow of a cypress
dapples the headstones
<|endoftext|>

Pomegranate jam
the wild smell
of autumn
<|endoftext|>

two pills
past midnight
hidden moon
<|endoftext|>

in the skeleton
of an old house
a new spider's web
<|endoftext|>

midnight ...
a cricket's falsetto
from the lingerie drawer
<|endoftext|>

the last dance -
her cheap perfume
don't matter
<|endoftext|>

coastal fort
a spider catches
the breeze
<|endoftext|>

Day of the Dead --
my unshaved face
in the mirror
<|endoftext|>

after a lobotomy
the pumpkins 
toothless grin
<|endoftext|>

for a moment
i am the heron
first light
<|endoftext|>

full moon
a swollen tick
on the sows ear
<|endoftext|>

applesauce
bubbles on the stove
november morning
<|endoftext|>

the beggar
counting coins . . .
first stars
<|endoftext|>

veteran's day
photo of the uncle
I never met
<|endoftext|>

Saturday morning drizzle . . .
a driving lesson 
with my dad
<|endoftext|>

forest bathing . . .
the scent of her
wildflower shampoo
<|endoftext|>

the owl
i hear but never see
november dusk
<|endoftext|>

unripe pomegranates --
all that's left
between us
<|endoftext|>

those shells
we collected for her
high tide
<|endoftext|>

deep wrinkles
in the face of an elder
becoming dusk
<|endoftext|>

fading light--
the last sunflowers
half price
<|endoftext|>

war vet on the corner
holding a sign
someones son
<|endoftext|>

snow fury
the coffeecup still warm
in my hand
<|endoftext|>

the clattering
of mahjong tiles ...
summer rain
<|endoftext|>

the end
of a chalk rainbow --
foreclosure sign
<|endoftext|>

downsizing ...
a winter star and I
in the puddle
<|endoftext|>

insomnia
the rat trap
snapping shut
<|endoftext|>

morning thunder --
the garbage man's
early start
<|endoftext|>

in the treetops
lingering,
remains of the day
<|endoftext|>

fite freest -
anither year
aulder
<|endoftext|>

stubbled fields
a fresh coat of snow
on a rusted pickup
<|endoftext|>

winter wind
he says my name
with a sigh
<|endoftext|>

the odds of his
dying before me...
snow mixes with rain
<|endoftext|>

summer lilac
bent to the heat
of the railroad 
<|endoftext|>

a hearse leaves
the prison compound
cold moon
<|endoftext|>

heavy snow
the smell of hot soup
under a neon cross
<|endoftext|>

my own pace --
tiny flower blooms
from a crack in concrete
<|endoftext|>

Infinite white -
a solitary tree
supporting the sky
<|endoftext|>

winter night
old trees
filled with stars
<|endoftext|>

morning sun
a constellation of holes
in the rhubarb leaf
<|endoftext|>

autumn equinox--
the snap
of a plumb line
<|endoftext|>

waiting
for the meds to kick in
full moon
<|endoftext|>

everything
im not
winter rain
<|endoftext|>

this slow healing
a blackbird almost invisible 
in the winter dusk
<|endoftext|>

mid december 
candles line the window sill 
silent night
<|endoftext|>

grain silos
long shadows
on fresh snow
<|endoftext|>

dudoon
aye wairmth
in her rosary beads
<|endoftext|>

cup of tea ---
the moon still
until i sip it
<|endoftext|>

candles flicker
through my eyelids
zazen
<|endoftext|>

weight that shifts
with the news of a death
storm light
<|endoftext|>

falling star
another woman says
'me too'
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the growing darkness
on death row
<|endoftext|>

early winter -
yellow windows
in the blue dawn
<|endoftext|>

loneliness; 
the trail of a raindrop
down the pane
<|endoftext|>

snowstorm
another poem
too wordy
<|endoftext|>

nightfall..
my thoughts linger awhile
on the old days
<|endoftext|>

Flank to the sunrise
Old donkey taking winter
one day at a time
<|endoftext|>

blizzard warning --
wishing I hadn't seen
that black cat
<|endoftext|>

scattered in the ditch 
like tiny scraps of blue sky
bits of plastic bag
<|endoftext|>

dusting off
the piano keys
autumn wind
<|endoftext|>

autumn rain
puddles fill up
with moonlight
<|endoftext|>

sparks when 
i take off my robe
winter drought
<|endoftext|>

in the soup line
each man turned
toward the sun
<|endoftext|>

eclipse
the sudden darkness
of her eyes
<|endoftext|>

mountain chapel
the rain-washed
bones of a sheep
<|endoftext|>

winter stars
moth carcasses dot
the window screen
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice
the Virgin Mary receives
a new light bulb
<|endoftext|>

cold night--
snowflakes settle
on coal cars
<|endoftext|>

winter evening
the last dried pepper
goes into the soup
<|endoftext|>

interstate
an Amish buggy wavers
in a thermal
<|endoftext|>

equinox
the double ferris wheel
across the lake
<|endoftext|>

all day rain
lowering the blinds
in her dollhouse
<|endoftext|>

late night stroll
through parted curtains
lives of others
<|endoftext|>

profound blue of night 
the resin and salt of pines
so far from the sea
<|endoftext|>

surfing waves
a tiny lizard 
on corrugated iron
<|endoftext|>

deep winter
red beans one day
white beans the next
<|endoftext|>

insomnia
a lone light 
on the mountainside
<|endoftext|>

long before I came
long after I leave
blossoming pear
<|endoftext|>

winter blizzard ..
her psoriasis
shedding skin
<|endoftext|>

winter thunder
i let tea leaves
release the tannins
<|endoftext|>

lighting 
the paper lantern--
autumn sunset
<|endoftext|>

Groundhog Day
another friend
returns to earth
<|endoftext|>

missing you
the cry of the loon
from shore to shore
<|endoftext|>

murmurs in her sleep--
the moon slips behind
the clouds
<|endoftext|>

open window--
lemon scented tea tree
in the rain
<|endoftext|>

child's paintbox 
every color untouched
except blue
<|endoftext|>

empty cafe
the tip jar fills
with rain
<|endoftext|>

another button
lost along the way
lifting fog
<|endoftext|>

radio dial . . .
trying to find
my youth
<|endoftext|>

lunar eclipse
the weight of 
anothers shadow
<|endoftext|>

chinook wind
the softness of a day
in february
<|endoftext|>

long day over
at last
alone with the wind
<|endoftext|>

idle conversation
the daffodils nodding
In the breeze
<|endoftext|>

Indian summer
a yellowed postcard
falls from the book
<|endoftext|>

open house --
the rushed paint strokes
of the guest room
<|endoftext|>

prairie winter --
clouds approach
the broken fence
<|endoftext|>

weaving
through traffic . . .
two white butterflies
<|endoftext|>

jury break . . . 
we free hollyhock seeds
in the courthouse garden
<|endoftext|>

office window
comings and goings
of butterflies
<|endoftext|>

beach stroll
dipping our feet
in the stars
<|endoftext|>

left to simmer
the kettle shrieks
until answered
<|endoftext|>

slice by slice
the pie disappears
blueberry stains
<|endoftext|>

noon
the egret shifts from stillness
to stillness
<|endoftext|>

typos
in her apology
spring weeds
<|endoftext|>

learning to eat 
around bruises 
winter apples
<|endoftext|>

insomnia
a light flickers
in the foothills
<|endoftext|>

spring morning
a railroad bridge
into fog
<|endoftext|>

the smell
before the sound of it
evening rain
<|endoftext|>

thunderheads
hanging on the horizon
a red tailed hawk
<|endoftext|>

kites tangle
in summer twilight
father and son
<|endoftext|>

train whistle 
in the distance
another sleepless night
<|endoftext|>

silent 
as a mouse
the trap
<|endoftext|>

kissing the widow
along her silver neck chain
the glint of his ring
<|endoftext|>

in the fog
a mountain echoes
blackbird at dawn
<|endoftext|>

cloudless sky
a red kite 
fades into the distance
<|endoftext|>

Easter Sunday--
my mother's bible
stuffed with obits
<|endoftext|>

sun striking
the hour glass
spring equinox
<|endoftext|>

afternoon heat
the faraway sea
in a gulls cry
<|endoftext|>

Mother's Day
three bouquets
of emoji roses
<|endoftext|>

briefly
the day pauses
first butterfly
<|endoftext|>

morning rush
cup of tea
untouched
<|endoftext|>

in spite of
bombs and lies
wildflowers
<|endoftext|>

electric storm
out of a dark horizon
a raven's eye
<|endoftext|>

summer thunderstorm
filling air with tension
she crosses her thighs
<|endoftext|>

taking the old road
to my father's stone
the slow tilt of stars
<|endoftext|>

nude in the sauna
the young woman pours water
on stony silence
<|endoftext|>

bright and full
above the fields
coyote song
<|endoftext|>

finding her place
between black and white
the young eagle
<|endoftext|>

first spring sun
the naked legs
of a window cleaner
<|endoftext|>

late frost -
putting some salt
on the red wine stain
<|endoftext|>

freezing rain
the cafe crooner slips
out of tune
<|endoftext|>

morning fog
a railroad crossing
at the end of the world
<|endoftext|>

ginko
the group returns
with a hundred selfies
<|endoftext|>

glowing embers
I start my story
from the end
<|endoftext|>

everything
we have in common...
plum blossom rain
<|endoftext|>

starless night
a lantern boat sailing
out to sea
<|endoftext|>

the roshis 
incense-smoked robe
weight of winter
<|endoftext|>

leaving the dust
of the world behind
summer tea
<|endoftext|>

ghost pines
under a crescent moon
summer drought
<|endoftext|>

up
with the chickens
bayou sun
<|endoftext|>

lemon tea
and lavender oil
the rain on repeat
<|endoftext|>

pond at dusk 
frogs and blackbirds
in conversation
<|endoftext|>

soft rain . . .
the way the oncologist
says "we"
<|endoftext|>

thinking of her
in the past tense . . .
cloud shadow
<|endoftext|>

gaza
murdered children
my faded lilacs
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorm
clap of skateboards
in the park
<|endoftext|>

neighbors clematis
on my side of the fence
free love
<|endoftext|>

oh blue-haired girl
your stockings and Docs make me
a little older
<|endoftext|>

frozen again
under soft spring snow
concrete cracks
<|endoftext|>

climbing
the way her work heels
hang off the steps
<|endoftext|>

breakup 
my daughter's voice cracks
across two continents
<|endoftext|>

far from Wall Street
a cormorant
dives
<|endoftext|>

breakup kiss ...
the line between sky
and winter sea
<|endoftext|>

lighting a candle 
with a candle
another night of snow
<|endoftext|>

tying a knot
in the grass blade
midsummer
<|endoftext|>

a dead key
on the grand piano
winter darkness
<|endoftext|>

old sandbox
the weeds
all grown up
<|endoftext|>

darkening skies
cattle clatter down the ramp
into the abattoir
<|endoftext|>

french kissing
on the bridge with love locks
two pink-haired girls
<|endoftext|>

sad news --
opening the windows
to let the chill out
<|endoftext|>

unknotting
the phone cord
mothers day
<|endoftext|>

pausing between
rain showers
summer solstice
<|endoftext|>

retirement home 
the same pot of coffee 
sitting all day
<|endoftext|>

long blue tail
of a damselfly
kite festival
<|endoftext|>

after the rainstorm
another thought
about last night
<|endoftext|>

thunderstorm downpour
thrashing against the window
her sweat on my lips
<|endoftext|>

fading bruises
birdsong
in the distance
<|endoftext|>

When my time is done
remember I saw swallows
taking their first flight
<|endoftext|>

dry spell -- 
dead-heading 
wild roses
<|endoftext|>

spring fever
tree roots cracking
the concrete
<|endoftext|>

tourist season
the zen garden
fills up with noise
<|endoftext|>

between two
decrepit buildings
poplar in late evening light
<|endoftext|>

death anniversary
a curl of incense smoke
stuck on the ceiling
<|endoftext|>

I watch someone
watch someone else
the promise of rain
<|endoftext|>

bare hill
broken glass sparkling
where the sun moves
<|endoftext|>

summer storm . . .
I push the beetle
back on its feet
<|endoftext|>

summers end
in a jar of shells
the smell of salt air
<|endoftext|>

early morning dew
squeezing the last drop
from my teabag
<|endoftext|>

thunder moon
long-awaited rainstorm rips 
through the arroyo
<|endoftext|>

Southend-on-Sea
freshly fried chips
on the salt air
<|endoftext|>

abandoned steelworks
a small weed
cracking concrete
<|endoftext|>

prairie dogs
mares tails
over Little Big Horn
<|endoftext|>

pregnant again . . .
the fluttering of moths
against the window
<|endoftext|>

a dragonfly
on a dragonfly
summer heat
<|endoftext|>

pranayama
the candle goes out
as it lights another
<|endoftext|>

midnight . . .
scent of the incense stick
burning itself
<|endoftext|>

subway transfer
the homeless lady
sells mirrors
<|endoftext|>

white satin 
cool against her skin
choosing a coffin
<|endoftext|>

fortieth birthday
fastening my old belt
at a new hole
<|endoftext|>

after the storm
mountains return
a bit softer
<|endoftext|>

cottonwood leaves
the quiet way
they soften the night
<|endoftext|>

one finger
raised in greeting
heat wave
<|endoftext|>

blackberry brambles
along the road
blues on the radio
<|endoftext|>

summer break
the sun scatters
my freckles
<|endoftext|>

Oregon summer
The haze from distant wildfires 
turning the moon red
<|endoftext|>
