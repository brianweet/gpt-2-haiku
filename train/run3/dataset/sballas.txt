still sky
no birds, no breeze
morning after the war
<|endoftext|>

daylilies . . .
my son's face
freckled orange
<|endoftext|>

sudden rainstorm
the dog shakes off
each drop
<|endoftext|>

white kimono
often confused
with nine hundred count percale
<|endoftext|>

earthquake alarm...
trees raise their hands
towards the sky
<|endoftext|>

cubical snug, plays
solitaire, eats like you would
load a pellet gun
<|endoftext|>

rocking chair
sits in the attic
counting years
<|endoftext|>

deep shadows
i play hide and seek
with the sun
<|endoftext|>

pipe leaking
a way to get to know
new neighbors
<|endoftext|>

watching a sunset
in black and white
the color-blind man
<|endoftext|>

first dew touch?
shyly, the lily unfolds
her petals
<|endoftext|>

she's plucking eyebrows
from the wall mirror like an
escher drawn escher
<|endoftext|>

spring breeze
smell of flowers and
starch
<|endoftext|>

this longest night?
knitting the baby's blanket
into socks
<|endoftext|>

bottoms in the air
a line
of missing ducks
<|endoftext|>

half moon?
dog's bark above
the factory noise
<|endoftext|>

what wind finds you here
begging shadows, coins tapping
songs for an alley
<|endoftext|>

growing sideways
in the deep forest?
a single birch
<|endoftext|>

skeletons of the aspen,
snowflakes dance
the winter away.
<|endoftext|>

sipping green tea
from a styrofoam cup...
stomach in knots
<|endoftext|>

the blue-eyed cat, gone
was it coyotes
or that flock of big ravens?
<|endoftext|>

freeing the ego
doesn't mean abandoning
your love of peaches
<|endoftext|>

clank of iron?
two butterflies ascend
in their mating dance
<|endoftext|>

black cars drive themselves
suits, wind flutters pages, me
buried in my clothes
<|endoftext|>

curls of smoke,
rise from my coffeepot.
the soft patter of rain.
<|endoftext|>

drifting
with the snow
a plastic bag
<|endoftext|>

a silver scimitar
new moon slices
night blue sky
<|endoftext|>

rabbits at market,
their furs pulled off like mittens?
shiny, newborn limbs.
<|endoftext|>

little windfall apples?
cartoon cherry bombs
that went pffft
<|endoftext|>

frost on morning glass
winter's gentle face, voices
whisper through windows
<|endoftext|>

on both sides
of the cemetery fence
wild flowers
<|endoftext|>

and there lies the ocean,
so grey and deep,
a bobbing yacht.
<|endoftext|>

i fill the feeder
chickadee sings
we are grateful
<|endoftext|>

the dust of two towers
is slowly obscured by smoke
from a thousand towns.
<|endoftext|>

prickly pear?
hidden in golden grass,
still green and holding
<|endoftext|>

a sunflower field
millions of tiny faces
smiling in daylight
<|endoftext|>

a soft whisper of breeze,
dandelions gently sway,
fleeting time
<|endoftext|>

small bird
on a cattail
not singing
<|endoftext|>

night walk full moon
steel rails gleam
to vanishing point
<|endoftext|>

over the hayfields,
a barn owl floats, searching.
ok, i'll listen too.
<|endoftext|>

between the trees
swoop of coloured wing and feather
and hammock song of summer
<|endoftext|>

his face
next to mine?
whiskers
<|endoftext|>

purple scented air
hovering over the lilacs
transient moment
<|endoftext|>

goodbye hug
the blue of the
forget me nots
<|endoftext|>

clay on the wheel
deep breath
reaching for the centre
<|endoftext|>

budding romance...
between them on the porch swing
a just opening rose
<|endoftext|>

an hour's walk
and getting nowhere?
the treadmill
<|endoftext|>

skin against my palm
you trace translucent road maps
read, cartographer
<|endoftext|>

he shows me his tattoo?
the tree shadow
on the sidewalk
<|endoftext|>

strong breeze
clouds sweep by
the top of the tree
<|endoftext|>

curling up
when problems arise
armadillo
<|endoftext|>

spring recital?
mozart on the piano keys
bird warbles at the window
<|endoftext|>

left in the closet
an umbrella, forgotten
rain cloud emptying
<|endoftext|>

the sweat dripping drip-
ping into your eyes like tears
for all my efforts
<|endoftext|>

sleeping in?
his side of the bed
still warm
<|endoftext|>

roots of the dead spruce
reach out bony fingers
secret life exposed
<|endoftext|>

spring break
crocus pokes its head
through the melting of march
<|endoftext|>

radiant heater
a cat by the window
purrs
<|endoftext|>

echoes of sunset
your upturned face a canvas?
splashed watercolor
<|endoftext|>

exchange
of wedding vows?
the incoming tide
<|endoftext|>

from tree-shadow to
lighted pools, startled koi: paint-
brush lines on water.
<|endoftext|>

we will miss you -
farewell, mr. vonnegut.
i laughed; wept
<|endoftext|>

bowl of tomatoes
first hint of ripening
early dawn glow
<|endoftext|>

glasses on table -
grandpa passed in june,
only two months away
<|endoftext|>

smile amphibian
servile fly crowning frog prince
order among thieves
<|endoftext|>

plane ticket to france
like a "fuck thou" ode to you
if i had the balls
<|endoftext|>

coarse white pubic hair
sign of fleeting time old age
now at the ready
<|endoftext|>

bursts over belt loops
designer brand across her ass
"guess" what?... your weight?
<|endoftext|>

to touch, be touched
is everything worth wanting
yes, there and yes, that
<|endoftext|>

mountains, but not stone?
white sculptures too pure for hands.
i break like a wave.
<|endoftext|>

a photo is all
we have of our rendezvous
between here and there.
<|endoftext|>

snow on the ground
streetlamps are on
at four o'clock
<|endoftext|>

still, white cityscape
belies fury of last night's
edmonton blizzard
<|endoftext|>

luminescent lures
draw them close to its dark mouth
the nightclub swallows
<|endoftext|>

lightning eyes flashing
and your face darkens and clouds
thunder comes after
<|endoftext|>

quick steps on hard wood,
a racing heart / shadow hips,
scream of passing skin.
<|endoftext|>

winter is a birth
of lofty expectations
for the next season.
<|endoftext|>

elton john sings
a texas love song as
first snow falls
<|endoftext|>

time flows freely, like
water in a river, no
dam can hold it back
<|endoftext|>

dusk rain surrenders
bright clouds bleed a war-red
kurosawa sky
<|endoftext|>

graying sky soaring;
a roof above the heads of
mortal creatures beneath
<|endoftext|>

in the hour of foxes
shadows slip and slink around
edges of perception
<|endoftext|>

flesh gnaws at its chains.
tainted souls dance in rubble /
echoes murmur in the skin.
<|endoftext|>

familiar photos on the wall
remind me of who i am
but who the fuck are they?
<|endoftext|>

iridescence
painting colour in the moist air
clouds weeping prisms
<|endoftext|>

fall's blaze of folly
deposits rich red blood cells
on winter's bare bones
<|endoftext|>

freshly shaved legs
and washed my sheets today
going to bed bliss
<|endoftext|>

the smell of wet earth
streetlight halos in the rain;
yukatta raincoat
<|endoftext|>

no washrooms anywhere;
crouching behind a tree
i can hear everything now
<|endoftext|>

drowning in whiskey -
she left again
and keeps leaving
<|endoftext|>

burned trees among
the fading living:
reminder
<|endoftext|>

coffee with buddha
i talk about my worries
his dick-ass smile.
<|endoftext|>

broken umbrellas
young women's hats-flattened
cormorant weather
<|endoftext|>

corner store:
spider's built a web
across the butterfly nets
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon?
still, i turn my gaze back
to the muddied path
<|endoftext|>

good night, fair city
your belly button sex drive
makes me fucking sick
<|endoftext|>

trying to tune in
a song of the soul but my
reception is bad
<|endoftext|>

not willing to leave
this imperfect nest, this bird
has so much to learn.
<|endoftext|>

water into wine
every time you look at me
my girl parts get drunk
<|endoftext|>

starlings gossip
amused at our lovemaking
the quivering limbs
<|endoftext|>

winter chill-
around the windy corner,
surprise! full moon.
<|endoftext|>

midnight:
bats are diving
"it's hot," she says
<|endoftext|>

whiskey and cigars
perfect companions for this
mountainous refuge
<|endoftext|>

spring football players
pop and hustle, grunting.
yearless. fatter.
<|endoftext|>

alone tonight-
how blue
the moonlit iris
<|endoftext|>

the clouds open up
a halo of rain, downpour
your lips, glistening
<|endoftext|>

luggage gone astray
'welcome home' from purring cat
the best elixir
<|endoftext|>

curvaceous woman
vibrates at the edge of you
a dark, sultry lie
<|endoftext|>

fading oil worker
bedded now, and filled with tar
counting his regrets
<|endoftext|>

he begins by contemplating
the blonde's navel
<|endoftext|>

paul mccartney,
a conspiracy theory:
he's really a douche
<|endoftext|>

think our moms won't know
<|endoftext|>

leather jackets protect well
river ice creaks loud
<|endoftext|>

disused bridge
mist flows
over the river
<|endoftext|>

driving home -
the rainbow
arrives there before me
<|endoftext|>

changing our sheets -
cherry blossom
drifts to the floor
<|endoftext|>

camping ground -
the cries
of other people's children
<|endoftext|>

leaving your home -
kowhai flowers
flick off my windscreen
<|endoftext|>

round and
round and round -
the moon
<|endoftext|>

lamplight -
a moth zigzags
between stars
<|endoftext|>

benefit cuts
her letter to santa
goes unanswered
<|endoftext|>

spring moon
she re-threads my dead
nana's pearls
<|endoftext|>

where soldiers
once slept and died -

<|endoftext|>

replying to his letter
the paper cold
against my hand
<|endoftext|>

a ponga frond
unwinding
<|endoftext|>

old pines
each one leans
apart
<|endoftext|>

walking over pebbles

grows heavy
<|endoftext|>

sunday morning
a dog sniffs the base
of the goal-post
<|endoftext|>

on a diet
she devours
recipe books
<|endoftext|>

through the mist

so close
<|endoftext|>

last sun
the footprints over the dunes
filled with shadow
<|endoftext|>

morning shallows
the wading birds
all conjoint
<|endoftext|>

low tide -
i walk to you
across the sky
<|endoftext|>

all this way
in your letter
that cigarette smell
<|endoftext|>

checking the map
the road disappears
into a fold
<|endoftext|>

weather forecast
searching the sky
for an isobar
<|endoftext|>

in the dark part
of her wardrobe -

at the back of the shop

in her hair

family photo box
how my father smiles
in black and white
<|endoftext|>

raindrops
and the sound
of a shoe being unlaced
<|endoftext|>

bitter tea - my teeth
leave indentations
in the polystyrene cup
<|endoftext|>

to write as simply
as you pick
a single blade of grass
<|endoftext|>

each day less light,
the smell of printer's ink
on the morning newspaper
<|endoftext|>

first snow,
the eyes of the sparrows
sharp and bright
<|endoftext|>

during the rainstorm
the child's colouring-in
becomes more intense

stops the window rattling

of a butterfly
<|endoftext|>

my mouth
full of fingers, the dentist
asks about holidays
<|endoftext|>

sunny day

on sweet corn cobs
<|endoftext|>

bringing
this sky inside
breath
<|endoftext|>

heat of the night
the folded stillness
of a rescued moth
<|endoftext|>

pear blossom
where the old white horse
used to stand
<|endoftext|>

approaching summer
the paths of the cattle
through the dew
<|endoftext|>

new moon and star
just the slightest curve
of her belly
<|endoftext|>

nose above the stick -
flight of wading birds
<|endoftext|>

wrecked ship
beside the memorial
a starfish
<|endoftext|>

midnight thirst
drinking from cupped hands
- a moth's closed wings
<|endoftext|>

in her bedroom

on the front lawn
trying to fly his kite -
the wind won't
<|endoftext|>

tartan umbrella
my own bright roof
in the alleyway

at an udder

into a distant horn
<|endoftext|>

first swallow . . .

slips away
<|endoftext|>

spirals
<|endoftext|>

coats dripping rain
we discuss
our addictions
<|endoftext|>

of her wrist
<|endoftext|>

bone chilling

between faded tea towels
her frayed pink bra
<|endoftext|>

of ten-grain bread
<|endoftext|>

sewing machine
<|endoftext|>

winter evening

from the hair dye box
<|endoftext|>

fills with leaves
<|endoftext|>

touches mine

and goes

passing into

<|endoftext|>

minute of silence . . .
a single fir needle
on the hardwood floor
<|endoftext|>

stuck in place

in the hawk's beak
<|endoftext|>

on another's back

on her head
<|endoftext|>

a peach
<|endoftext|>

after the funeral . . .

with each move

of the sea urchin
<|endoftext|>

cell phone ringtone
again in the mix
mockingbird
<|endoftext|>

no one calls
she gently dusts
her porcelain rabbits
<|endoftext|>

between us

caught
in the revolving door

follows its call

unravels

from his
<|endoftext|>

dusty hike

to the cows

with river rocks
<|endoftext|>

car ride
the child draws
a silent story
<|endoftext|>

drifting up
into old aspen trees
the sound of checkers
<|endoftext|>

changing his angle,
changing his song:
a thrush at dusk
<|endoftext|>

fast moving clouds
my grandson finds stones
that fit his hands
<|endoftext|>

sun-warmed room
the patina from his touch
on the hand drums
<|endoftext|>

a year
wiped away
dust on luggage
<|endoftext|>

at the corner
the shadow
splits in two
<|endoftext|>

emptying my bag . . .
the pebble makes me
think of the hill again
<|endoftext|>

a faint groove
round my ring finger
new moon
<|endoftext|>

spanning
the canyon wind
california condor
<|endoftext|>

such stillness
i absorb the sound
of creaking bamboo
<|endoftext|>

the glitz
an ant carries
morning sunshine
<|endoftext|>

the sparkle
in our conversation
sunshine on her knees
<|endoftext|>

his face
shaped by the speed
of his bike
<|endoftext|>

morning meditation
a moth
works the room
<|endoftext|>

confetti
in the grass
<|endoftext|>

waking up

on the lake
<|endoftext|>

bird song

spring morning
the art of walking beside
someone much older
<|endoftext|>

mist under the bridge
the drifting shapes
of hobos
<|endoftext|>

church graveyard
from somewhere close
the fragrance of lilies
<|endoftext|>

at the centre
of constant ripples
a moorhen's nod
<|endoftext|>

early spring
the young boys spinning
till they?re dizzy
<|endoftext|>

graveside
my breasts
leaking
<|endoftext|>

waxing moon
the sound of a butterfly
emerging
<|endoftext|>

spring rain
her finger shushes
my lips
<|endoftext|>

mile high . . .
adding my breath
to the clouds
<|endoftext|>

what do i know
about the untethered balloon
my daughter's embrace
<|endoftext|>

his ashes
turning into the current
the turtle's ears
<|endoftext|>

early morning
glue sets in the shade
of the old shed
<|endoftext|>

early warmth
in the backyard a flicker
pokes among rocks
<|endoftext|>

that dull gleam
through the hazy park
a playhouse window
<|endoftext|>

one maple leaf . . .
end over end on the sand
without a trace
<|endoftext|>

everywhere this morning
maple keys soaking in
the gentle rain
<|endoftext|>

summer dawn
light around the windows
as at grandmother's
<|endoftext|>

thump and screech
the long freight pulls out
in robin's song
<|endoftext|>

restless pigeons
gentle words from a clerk
bring a hint of tears
<|endoftext|>

crescent moon
would i look at the clouds
without it?
<|endoftext|>

how to tell
of the myriad rich browns?
pin-oak leaves
<|endoftext|>

persons and place
to view the moon
sake not quite full
<|endoftext|>

santoka too
passed away on this date
wine with my tears
<|endoftext|>

long road
the leaves and i
windblown
<|endoftext|>

sunshine
the colours
of the hill
<|endoftext|>

temple steps
his shoes
in the autumn rain
<|endoftext|>

backyard pine
what can i do
with all these crows
<|endoftext|>

his lantern's glow
pushing back the dark
frog song
<|endoftext|>

ebb tide
the heron steps
into twilight
<|endoftext|>

daybreak . . .
a migratory bird's feather
on the path
<|endoftext|>

love:
a kigo for all
seasons
<|endoftext|>

a memorial bell
tolls tolls and stops,
but his words . . .
<|endoftext|>

blue dragonfly
pine needles cover
the narrow path
<|endoftext|>

the mountain pine
holding the light,
held by it
<|endoftext|>

?bill's day?
draw the letters
in aspen-glow
<|endoftext|>

a little cold
and without the bright fish
this golden pond
<|endoftext|>

gray october
the poet's voice
outlives him
<|endoftext|>

full moon
and so my thoughts
turn to you
<|endoftext|>

vest pocket park
the leaves a little
less brilliant
<|endoftext|>

at his passing
a ripple in the river
of stars
<|endoftext|>

misty shroud
leaves falling
between the rails
<|endoftext|>

sunset fades
from the highest peak
autumn chill
<|endoftext|>

higginson's haiku
still among the living;
the autumn wind
<|endoftext|>

a teacher's passing . . .
moonlight bathes
the apple tree
<|endoftext|>

another light
now
among the stars
<|endoftext|>

a gentle breeze ripples
everywhere his words
leaves on grass
<|endoftext|>

opening his book . . .
the world he offered
tumbles out
<|endoftext|>

beyond emptiness
the moon filling itself
for certain
<|endoftext|>

autumn evening . . .
adding another star
to the milky way
<|endoftext|>

prayer flags
the autumn leaves carry
the blessings to you
<|endoftext|>

cloudy day
the janitor misses
a fallen leaf
<|endoftext|>

surf murmurs
the basso continuo
behind the dunes
<|endoftext|>

this fragility
white cranes laced
in the air
<|endoftext|>

dry autumn
the fading vibrance
of a spider lily
<|endoftext|>

hard to tell you
how i feel . . .
this late autumn sky
<|endoftext|>

petrified forest
a stone axe echoes
in the sky
<|endoftext|>

autumn ginko
one by one
into mist
<|endoftext|>

harvest home
a red nasturtium
heads for the stars
<|endoftext|>

a single breath
the ember
comes to life
<|endoftext|>

leaving us in autumn . . .
leaving behind him
the blossoms to come
<|endoftext|>

ebbing tide
a bright shell caught
by the current
<|endoftext|>

tree leaves fall
as the long journey begins
a fading hymn
<|endoftext|>

white hydrangea
fading
in white light
<|endoftext|>

insect chirps
lingering low on the ground
the later moon
<|endoftext|>

heavy fog
the mountain still back there
out of sight
<|endoftext|>

what a silence!
and nobody's around
to share it with
<|endoftext|>

migrating birds
i hear his voice in the wind
toward nirvanna
<|endoftext|>

bleu roi
a thousand flying foxes
quarter moon
<|endoftext|>

walking alone
the filtered sounds
of the hototogisu
<|endoftext|>

dusk
a half-ripe melon
frees itself from the vine
<|endoftext|>

patter of raindrops
in autumn leaves . . .
the seasons turn
<|endoftext|>

his passing . . .
the small fir collects
fallen leaves
<|endoftext|>

starry night . . .
a worn phone number
in the handbook
<|endoftext|>

morning frost
a monk's chant
crosses the river
<|endoftext|>

stalagmites
a passel of school children
up ahead
<|endoftext|>

autumn leaves . . .
in the book she gave me
an old library stamp
<|endoftext|>

autumn gust
the starlings? wings
tilt in unison
<|endoftext|>

withered juniper
mother's hair
since the nursing home
<|endoftext|>

village temple
kids behind the gods
playing hide and seek
<|endoftext|>

through endless rain
the whistle
of the paperboy
<|endoftext|>

the taste of cider
when fallen leaves begin
to overlap
<|endoftext|>

bustling shoppers
the bell ringer's
prosthetic hand
<|endoftext|>

winter solstice . . .
smoothing a folded corner
in my library book
<|endoftext|>

a single bubble
after the beaver dives
the rising moon
<|endoftext|>

the gardener
and his scarecrow
the same hat
<|endoftext|>

crows swagger
down the middle of the road
summer's end
<|endoftext|>

starting school tomorrow
he talks to trees
at the woods? edge
<|endoftext|>

labor day
a spot of barbecue sauce
on the face of my watch
<|endoftext|>

summer's end
two flies fighting
over me
<|endoftext|>

old blue car
the ease
of summer's last days
<|endoftext|>

a still, starry night
train tracks
wet with dew
<|endoftext|>

scudding clouds
the snake as long
as my sleeve
<|endoftext|>

stump speech
this black and white butterfly
in none of the field guides
<|endoftext|>

thundercloud
blue veins down to the heart
of the gentian
<|endoftext|>

sunburst . . .
bits of river
through the mangroves
<|endoftext|>

a whiff of kelp
as i clear out the trunk
summer moon
<|endoftext|>

scenic outlook
each step reveals
more grasshoppers
<|endoftext|>

jasmine in bloom
termites swarm
from their nest
<|endoftext|>

bark butter
a nuthatch
works the edges
<|endoftext|>

mountain slopes
getting wet as i walk
through clouds
<|endoftext|>

city bus stop . . .
the boy squats in the shadow
of his pregnant mother
<|endoftext|>

so many ways
to see the world
snake in the grass
<|endoftext|>

haloed moon
the hawker twirls
his glow bracelets
<|endoftext|>

summer dawn
the cat brings the rain
to bed
<|endoftext|>

summer stars
hot buttered corn
on our smiles
<|endoftext|>

summer brook
perfect skipping stone
on the other side
<|endoftext|>

on the front porch
<|endoftext|>

this is how life is
hearing the cricket at dawn
just as it ceases
<|endoftext|>

if someone should ask
tell them she loved
ginger snaps and tea
<|endoftext|>

a ripple
reaches the pond's edge

<|endoftext|>

warm hand held tightly
dream of a maple seedling
ready for planting
<|endoftext|>

her last breath . . .

by wind
<|endoftext|>

moonless

of returning geese
<|endoftext|>

at my parents? grave

of a hotdog stand
<|endoftext|>

of a stranger
<|endoftext|>
