======== SAMPLE 1 ========


The idea that a small business owner could be the only person in the market willing to serve you is not good for businesses

I love that I would like to be in a room with somebody that I'd love to eat dinner with

I really love that I have my dog

All my life i've wanted a dog

I never know how i was going to act

You never say anything but keep on rolling

I've got a big baby so that's not bad

It's one thing to go and visit friends or friends of friends

Doing things at the last minute feels like there's

no point in waiting

That's why i'm a mother

I need to get my head

In my life

For the better

It feels too tight

When I feel like
 I'm not able to do

This shit

All I'm doing is praying

My life just has to be perfect

That's my story

That's my experience

And now they say

All you need to do
 is go

I'm just

Gotta go

To bed

It's not just a

sad story

But this is

a sad

story

It's a sad

song

I just
 need some food and
 go sit by my
 book

My story has just
 come true
Thank you

Dear God God God!

So I'm in the back seat and it's raining so bad
I just wanna say

Thank you so much

I love you

I want to keep
 Your name

To always remember

The love that you're
 Giving
 is the
 real thing

I'm in love
 I just want to sleep
 and then I gotta
 write this
 letter
 I want to keep
 this memory
 Alive
 So many years

Left in me

I just want to die

I've got my
 to take care of
 Me
 I've lost my
 voice
 Now it's just
 my hands

I've got them

My eyes

Are just filled with
 tears I just
 gotta
 see that light

Come on look on me
 look on me
 come on

You're beautiful

Losing my mind

I just wanted to make
 sure of that
This whole time

I did feel like
 I was making
 a mistake
The whole time

So thank you so much

I really don't
 know

How you can
 help
 me with that
When it's out

and we can see

all the people
 That's all

that's left

Out of the game
 out of the game
 out of the game
 out of the game
 out of the game

All
 that's left to do
 is

be right back to do
 the same
 same
 I need
 you and I hate

what she is

So I feel as much
 like the whole
 country is
 all over me
 I wanna fight
 but i don't want
 people to know that
The thing I can't
 be afraid of
is myself

and my own
 I just want people to
 love me for who I am
and not tell the worst
 of me
What a strong and proud
 woman
She's been in my heart
For the past four
years
She's had nothing
 to do with it
It's just too
 painful
to write this
 I

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 be sure your body takes some of the blame for it.

The most important thing in life is not how big you are now, if you can't take one step forward then you are not doing it for the right reasons.

I truly think that in a future where a man is a good parent he'll grow up to be a better man because he understands that a good parent can make a good dad.

If there are women in the universe I'm a woman in the universe.

I do not have an ego you have an ego too which you will never be.

I've been called a fool but in the beginning I said it with a tone of voice
that was too confident
<|endoftext|>

It's okay you can only control you
your mistakes and make good plans but
you can't be perfect
<|endoftext|>

I hate going to the
 gym but when I'm there it's like I'm
living my life instead
<|endoftext|>

We get so busy with
that life and we forget the
good memories of the past
<|endoftext|>

You can get any job
 and you can get a girl to give
you a blowjob when you
<|endoftext|>

If you're looking to please
 and you've ever been called
a pussy on your first night

This is so beautiful
 and so crazy and it's so
beautiful on some nights
<|endoftext|>

The best things about
 getting off life support is
your body can go ahead
<|endoftext|>

We're going to miss you
 but just remember that you're better
than this
<|endoftext|>

So I got a question
 it is a very simple
one i hope you have something
to say in response
<|endoftext|>

It is not
 a matter of if but when
we see this thing come
back and it will be beautiful
<|endoftext|>

As a human being
 when I make mistakes it makes me
fear for the rest of my
life forever
<|endoftext|>

I have never ever
 taken a drink while on holidays
in my life i've done
<|endoftext|>

The world needs more
 of these amazing animals
we're still not a
<|endoftext|>

I never said there had
 to be a second date before
because I didn't
<|endoftext|>

I hope you are having
 an amazing weekend and
you all have a great week
<|endoftext|>

I don't even want
 to talk to my mom anymore
because she knows I'm
<|endoftext|>

Hearing you are in
 my head always makes me feel
like one with you as well
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna go
 and watch Netflix tonight
I just know i will go
<|endoftext|>

I've never seen the
 stars yet, but it seems like
we are seeing them
<|endoftext|>

It's a blessing to
 be the leader of your own
little town You are a leader
<|endoftext|>

I have a question
 and if you can give it to me
it's just a fact I
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to go
 and buy a new phone again
to replace this busted
<|endoftext|>

I was at a game
 on Saturday that was really
loud there's no way I'm not
<|endoftext|>

I still feel the pain
 from last week when I wasn't
tied in at the door
<|endoftext|>

When I was little I
 thought about myself in my
father's eyes like I'm the
<|endoftext|>

I'm not your real dad
 and I don't want anything from you
you're not my boy
<|endoftext|>

It wasn't that long ago
 that I'd gone to my first
finally date with
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to take a
 rest from this Monday night
for the rest of the week
<|endoftext|>

I miss my friends I miss her
 and I miss her more than anything
so thanks for your concern
<|endoftext|>

The best way to show that
 someone loves you is to let
them know with a smile

Is this how you get
 a job I'm not gonna lie
you're a fucking idiot
<|endoftext|>

So is this the new
 norm or maybe you're just the
one in the mood for the
<|endoftext|>

if you wanna be
 rich you should have more money
instead of being
<|endoftext|>

I just remember
 the last time i was in my house
at night and i was
<|endoftext|>

i feel like a
 baby that was kicked in the fuckin
face at a christmas party
<|endoftext|>

I know your boyfriend
 is your brother, but he's so
busy right now it's hard
<|endoftext|>

Just wanted to
 say that I have a dream
is a new year you know
<|endoftext|>

No one who is still
 in high school is even
trying to graduate
<|endoftext|>

i just wanna get
 a picture of you in
your bra i'm a fucking
<|endoftext|>

I'm a fucking
 stupid bitch because i got
a bad attitude
<|endoftext|>

A lot of people
 don't think their boyfriends are
that much better than they
<|endoftext|>

It is impossible
 for you to think clearly if you
are a troll shit
<|endoftext|>

I wish they would have
 done the same job for them last
years the only thing
<|endoftext|>

I wish i had
 an accent like they used
to do in japan
<|endoftext|>

I need to get
 a tattoo for how great I look
and my husband looks so
<|endoftext|>

I should be able get
 a job just so I can eat
the meal I want now
<|endoftext|>

The only person
 I miss is my husband so much
I've missed being with
<|endoftext|>

I'm so over
 watching The Warriors so I don't
do anything else
<|endoftext|>

So if Trump won
 he will be President of the
United States
<|endoftext|>

What are we gonna
 do with a man who won't
give a fuck about
<|endoftext|>

How do I keep
 myself comfortable without
my pants on at night
<|endoftext|>

That's really all it
 is really all about I want
a family with one
<|endoftext|>

I wonder why I
 can't sleep I really hate
being with these people
<|endoftext|>

What happened to
 her and me? That's the real question
now is she going
<|endoftext|>

I'm ready to
 leave this earth I'm ready
to leave before it's even
<|endoftext|>

You have only days
 to go before I'll be gone by
now you know what
<|endoftext|>

I'm so happy
 to be alive but so sad
that I can't even go
<|endoftext|>

I think your job
 for getting this girl I'll see
next week I'll see her
<|endoftext|>

I miss my dog
 a lot but not in the stupid
way you mean I do
<|endoftext|>

My husband is gonna
 put me in a van and keep
me there in all seasons
<|endoftext|>

He said she was
 an American citizen
And he really said that
<|endoftext|>

It's so easy to
 just be nice to someone that
is nice to you too
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna stay as
 long as I can when I still
have time to read but
<|endoftext|>

It's pretty funny
 when someone says you're not
the one this story comes
<|endoftext|>

When in doubt,
 just go out to the party
where y'all hang out I guess
<|endoftext|>

I don't see why
 I'm being held against
my will anymore
<|endoftext|>

I'm just feeling
 I'm a little tired and
I need some sleep I

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I
<|endoftext|>

i remember
 my grandma telling me i didn't
have to do it
<|endoftext|>

When you're the president
 of America your job is to
keep people happy
<|endoftext|>

Lol what have you done
 I'm not a big person but
he shouldn't be
<|endoftext|>

When is the last
 time you saw the world well the
past 12 months
<|endoftext|>

the greatest part about
 being in the same school
as someone who loves me
<|endoftext|>

I think the reason
 it has not gone well is the
resurgence of the right
<|endoftext|>

I really want to
 do this but I can't afford
to live I just gotta
<|endoftext|>

People forget there
 are people out there who
just want to be happy
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna get
 done before I go to sleep
and I don't wanna be
<|endoftext|>

If you can keep your
 hand off of a kid I'm more
than OK with that
<|endoftext|>

If only I
 knew how many kids that are
happily alive right
<|endoftext|>

You can do whatever
 you want I'll support you wherever
you are in life
<|endoftext|>

when does the game start
 again i am playing
a whole new game outta
<|endoftext|>

this song is just another
 great way to make people feel
good about other people
<|endoftext|>

You should put all your
 anger into writing a song
I'm ready for it
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you're on your
 birthday and people come in
with presents and shit
<|endoftext|>

Can someone please tell
 me how much I should take my
money out of the bank
<|endoftext|>

Good morning y'all know
 that no one really needs to
talk to ya all week
<|endoftext|>

If you ever see
 me on the face of the earth
I wanna kill you
<|endoftext|>

Can I call my friend
 on the phone to be like no
shit and give me a hug
<|endoftext|>

When people are nice
 to me they mean it on the first
day of my day
<|endoftext|>

I always have a
 smile on my face but never
have one on my hair
<|endoftext|>

A little bit of
 peace, some people need some
time to heal before
<|endoftext|>

i'm really trying
 to go through my closet
and get rid of stuff
<|endoftext|>

I wonder if I
 have a friend who loves me as much
as me I'm sad
<|endoftext|>

I'm a lot prettier
 than I was yesterday
but I can't believe it
<|endoftext|>

The only time i
 have a headache all day
is for my own health
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna do
 it again but im just too old
for it right now
<|endoftext|>

You never know what
 this girl is gonna do
to you when they don't have
<|endoftext|>

i'm not ready to
 be over anyone but
i'm ready to love
<|endoftext|>

I can't explain why
 I'm always the one to get
my ass beat and still
<|endoftext|>

All those white folks that
 hate on you for that have no
solution
<|endoftext|>

I would like a
 friend who can talk to my problems
without me bothering
<|endoftext|>

What we need is someone
 who can show what it really
takes like we've never done
<|endoftext|>

If you ever see
 something so strange or so
different it's your choice
<|endoftext|>

You don't know what a
 miracle it is to me
that I've not had cancer
<|endoftext|>

No matter how hard
 I fight i just can't beat you
all the way down to the bottom
<|endoftext|>

======== SAMPLE 1 ========

 and it is such a beautiful thing
the world is such a beautiful
world and i have so many
songs to sing my heart out
<|endoftext|>

It's so cool when you
 see one smile on your way out
after a long day
<|endoftext|>

This is exactly
 what I told it to be and
I still feel sorry
<|endoftext|>

If you would only
 let your friends and fans have this
blessing in your care
<|endoftext|>

We may look like we
 have no idea what you
mean but you do not
<|endoftext|>

I'm only gonna
 be here until this is done
and I'm done with this shit
<|endoftext|>

I'll tell you what it
 just got me I told myself it
would just be fun and
<|endoftext|>

Don't ever ever
 make it look like your face is
a ghost you just got caught
<|endoftext|>

You only get one
 choice to have a life and you
should have my vote
<|endoftext|>

Watched The Wizard
 and was so inspired by
the character I played
<|endoftext|>

I've been waiting to
 have someone in my life that
has done nothing but love
<|endoftext|>

This isn't about
 the money it's about the
man to be president
<|endoftext|>

I don't wanna fuck w
 my friends either Im gonna
beat it so bad this summer
<|endoftext|>

Gorgeous to see how
 fast my heart really beats just
for watching you
<|endoftext|>

I've been working so
 hard to not be tired or
uncomfortable
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe it's
 February so much better
and I'm living life now
<|endoftext|>

The only words I
 ever want to say are thank you
thank you and please do
<|endoftext|>

Why is someone who
 is married to the person
who is married to
<|endoftext|>

Someone got me with
 a little help to get me through
this crazy day
<|endoftext|>

The only way to
 see any future dreams is
to just give up hope now
<|endoftext|>

I have a few
 bad habits which I must
change so I can enjoy
<|endoftext|>

What will happen if
 we are in a battle for
the best of all time
<|endoftext|>

I'm really not into
 the music industry
now but I have to
<|endoftext|>

The only reason I
 like working in a small space
is because it's a lot
<|endoftext|>

My parents and I have
 gone to the gym a few
times today so I
<|endoftext|>

The only way for
 you to become a man is
to not fall in love
<|endoftext|>

This man needs to learn
 to listen to all that he says
before he speaks again
<|endoftext|>

my sister called in
 I'm hungry and I need some
pizza and cookies
<|endoftext|>

Can't believe they never
 brought back the B-Roll for that one
in the movie
<|endoftext|>

I always tell people
 to be nice to someone when they
say they're nice you just
<|endoftext|>

This guy's in love with
 a girl he's never seen before
and she's just not a good
<|endoftext|>

I have a lot of
 things going on right now It's
going to get a lot
<|endoftext|>

I've been reading every
 sentence in any book that
I pick up right now
<|endoftext|>

I'm so happy for
 you Your mom always is
the best for me
<|endoftext|>

My parents and I
 want you to know your name is
Bryan and I'd love
<|endoftext|>

You have to be real
 to just know one person in
your body and have
<|endoftext|>

No matter what I'm
 ready just want to be home and
have a hug with you

======== SAMPLE 1 ========


"

And I
 haven't been here
 for like
 an eternity
<|endoftext|>

my momma was gonna buy
 me a lot of clothes
when i was younger
<|endoftext|>

so far so good i got
 no regret but i hate
me for that
<|endoftext|>

The internet is
 a wonderful place just like
everyone else
<|endoftext|>

I really wish people
 would stop going through with
the lies of the past
<|endoftext|>

I'm getting ready
 for the holidays but you
can tell I want a break
<|endoftext|>

Don't miss this time for
 anything but a good old
bitch time of year
<|endoftext|>

my husband wants to
 see the next season of
the show but he's too damn
<|endoftext|>

Is this why people
 like a bitch because they'll
lose their shit when they see
<|endoftext|>

I have this strange
 feeling that someone's gonna
get a bit choked up
<|endoftext|>

I'm feeling really
 weird lately and my heart
feels like it's been ripped
<|endoftext|>

Wondering what that
 kid from The Little Prince
would have done with
<|endoftext|>

My kids are gonna
 be playing with the little bu
girl too soon
<|endoftext|>

Ain't no one out
 here that don't work for a living
at least now in the
<|endoftext|>

I like you so
 much and can go no matter
if someone be in the
<|endoftext|>

I'm looking forward
 to seeing your next album
in the new year
<|endoftext|>

I remember when
 I was a girl I'd go into
a shop and they'd have me
<|endoftext|>

I don't really have
 a lot of faith in humanity
to be so great
<|endoftext|>

This is so fucking
 stupid I wanna scream in
a fit of laughter
<|endoftext|>

Someone put a bunch
 of ice to the roof of the
canary and that shit
<|endoftext|>

If a woman wants
 to marry one of these
chickens he'll kiss her
<|endoftext|>

i'm happy not that
 I can get pregnant I think
it's going to be
<|endoftext|>

No one wants to see
 my boobs at church so I guess
I've got the money
<|endoftext|>

This is my first time
 actually feeling bad about
being an American
<|endoftext|>

I don't like when people
 act like i'm their friend or have
such a nice personality
<|endoftext|>

my bf is such a
 douche and this makes me so sad
i hate him so much
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes I think the
 people who get to be in my
life probably don't
<|endoftext|>

Not just today I
 had to pee I don't know what
took the fuck outta me
<|endoftext|>

I'll be honest if
 your going to do anything
to me don't even
<|endoftext|>

Don't forget to do
 the same on the week when
you go home this weekend
<|endoftext|>

Don't expect this from
 anyone as long as you
do their job right
<|endoftext|>

How can you write something
 and think it's going to have
the reaction it
<|endoftext|>

I'll be on top of
 everything today I don't
want anybody
<|endoftext|>

My hair is so
 much prettier today than back
when I got so many
<|endoftext|>

You're the only one
 that can say I got paid when
it was time for me
<|endoftext|>

How do I know if
 I'm ready to get married
or go to my sister
<|endoftext|>

The last thing I want
 is another divorce
fraud from someone else
<|endoftext|>

My brother is such
 an ass and he's been so good
to

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
they love me so much, but I gotta work.' I really don't know how to change that
<|endoftext|>

i'm super upset that
 my boyfriend left me because of
I love him too much
<|endoftext|>

All these people
 are trying to talk about me
for me to like it
<|endoftext|>

You need a reason
 for someone to exist but
they don't I'm
<|endoftext|>

If you find the words
 to explain what he thinks he
does well you need
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna make
 money for a few days I
don't want to be here
<|endoftext|>

So many things I
 want to get done today And but
I really
<|endoftext|>

I'm just gonna say
 please stop making me cry
And take care of me
<|endoftext|>

We can all learn a
 lot from him it just takes
time i promise you
<|endoftext|>

I get why you want
 to make you happy the
resistance isn't
<|endoftext|>

If the person you
 don't know who lives next door to
you can tell them
<|endoftext|>

He also gave me
 the same message at that time
He still has it
<|endoftext|>

I hate to be
 mean but no one's worse that
you all should be happy
<|endoftext|>

Don't forget that you
 are beautiful and beautiful
in your own ways
<|endoftext|>

Yay it's raining
 We have so much to do today
and hopefully we
<|endoftext|>

i just want some love
 in my life like my ex can
make that happen
<|endoftext|>

I don't want to talk
 with anyone who doesn't
speak Spanish i'm scared
<|endoftext|>

i just want to be
 an average good looking person
in a year or two
<|endoftext|>

I don't think anyone
 deserves their own home and that's
a shitty thing to give
<|endoftext|>

i was about to
 give myself a heart attack
but oh well i'm happy
<|endoftext|>

I really was
 gonna skip dinner and go
to the gym but I
<|endoftext|>

If it ain't broke don't
 fix it Don't fix what's not
broken don't fix what's
<|endoftext|>

i've never wanted
 a tattoo in my whole life yep
i don't love me anymore
<|endoftext|>

If I had to just
 just put out I would say I
was born to be happy
<|endoftext|>

you have an old
 car and that looks so pretty on
the windows it's like a
<|endoftext|>

Hiding behind
 you and telling lies about
me just pisses me
<|endoftext|>

You were my hope
 in life and all my dreams are
all gone now I miss
<|endoftext|>

Can't wait for my
 new boyfriend to be born so
I never have to
<|endoftext|>

I always have an
 idea of something then
I run over it
<|endoftext|>

This isn't going
 my way but it's a good thing
that I am the same
<|endoftext|>

He's also gonna
 be the first one to try and
put away the knife
<|endoftext|>

I've been waiting for
 the day I can go in and
have a beer with my
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe I'm
 on vacation with my best friend
so much so fast x
<|endoftext|>

Lemme guess who's
 gonna come visit me tomorrow
if i'm able
<|endoftext|>

I've been missing a
 lot of my friends this week but
I must have missed the
<|endoftext|>

The guy just asked me
 if i'm a virgin and i
honestly can't answer
<|endoftext|>

the next thing i know
 i'm at a hotel room
and i'm going to die
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

i'm so excited
 to start my first marathon
by running my first race
<|endoftext|>

Loving my new
 favorite pair of jeans I
could wear to work
<|endoftext|>

I love my boyfriend
 so much I always think about
him at the office
<|endoftext|>

I've made a mistake
 I forgot what I'm doing
I'm gonna die tonight
<|endoftext|>

People forget your
 worth just be there for them when
they need it most
<|endoftext|>

Hoping I'm not
 the only one that does this
if somebody helps
<|endoftext|>

It's raining but
 it's raining everywhere
now how can I play this
<|endoftext|>

I feel like a
 bitch and I hate myself to
my face so much bitch
<|endoftext|>

I wonder when the
 rest of the day will roll around
It's been such a bitch
<|endoftext|>

i always think i'm
 just gonna be sleeping until
somebody knocks me
<|endoftext|>

No worries I'm here
 to help you find your dreams and
you can have them right
<|endoftext|>

Someone's gonna have
 to go through this bitch you can't
take it either way
<|endoftext|>

I'm so thankful to
 have a great friend to support
my thoughts and dreams no
<|endoftext|>

I'm in love with
 your music I can never
get enough of it
<|endoftext|>

People tell you
 to be good all the time but it's
no excuse to be
<|endoftext|>

You're doing it for
 someone else you've never met
you're wrong for the same
<|endoftext|>

Hate to be the one
 to make you jealous but that
is how I've had to be
<|endoftext|>

I was born with a
 pair of socks and a pair of
shorts but today a
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes I miss things
 but I think I might just have
some new things soon
<|endoftext|>

No matter how much
 I struggle my brain will find
a way to do things
<|endoftext|>

If your a girl that
 cares about a guy then you're
a fag today
<|endoftext|>

I've been wanting to
 be a comedian forever
but I have to work
<|endoftext|>

So people say nothing
 they don't even know how they
feel about things lol
<|endoftext|>

I still love you the
 way that you are and I don't
condemn you or your work
<|endoftext|>

Y'all think it's going
 too fast but my brain just told
me to stop this morning
<|endoftext|>

So excited for
 Halloween I just had to
find a costume
<|endoftext|>

I know this ain't no
 joke when you want the boys to
have a party but
<|endoftext|>

I'm starting to get
 into the New Year thinking
I wanna party
<|endoftext|>

I didn't wanna
 say goodbye and I love it
I love you forever
<|endoftext|>

Hitting a wall with
 no one to talk to and I
just wanna die now
<|endoftext|>

I'm always being
 too self conscious with my
shoes and my shit sometimes
<|endoftext|>

My girlfriend hates me
 if I'm around her no way
to convince her I love
<|endoftext|>

I really miss you
 I can always count on you
to make it better
<|endoftext|>

I can never get
 over watching John Madden
on Monday Night Football
<|endoftext|>

Never miss a chance
 to do whatever that's
your intention is
<|endoftext|>

I'm looking forward
 to being in a new state
of mind today
<|endoftext|>

We are going to
 have some problems tomorrow
I'm not letting it go
<|endoftext|>

When people tell you
 you don't fit in I love

<|endoftext|>

Happiest days have
 been when you've got a full belly of
beer and a good mood
<|endoftext|>

I'm getting so tired
 I've been through so much I just
don't care anymore
<|endoftext|>

My mother is my
 best friend I love her so much
my whole life no matter
<|endoftext|>

I haven't been here
 in two days and I'm exhausted
It's about time to
<|endoftext|>

I'd never even
 know when I was sleeping but
I'm so tired
<|endoftext|>

When she said he
 has a nice ass smile she should
have known it was coming
<|endoftext|>

When someone tells you
 that you will always be
something better than them
<|endoftext|>

I have nothing worth
 me in my life and I'm more
than happy with this
<|endoftext|>

When people say no
 I say no to everything
And I want everything
<|endoftext|>

This isn't the first
 I get that there is a real
strong feeling right there
<|endoftext|>

I never knew I
 was so good at social
connections wow thank
<|endoftext|>

I was already
 excited about this game
I hope it turns out
<|endoftext|>

Someone said to me
 that the weather was better
when you're sleeping in
<|endoftext|>

I want a baby
 I want a baby I want
some milk on me
<|endoftext|>

I haven't been at
 my full potential and I
really have let down
<|endoftext|>

If anyone wants
 advice please don't reply just
ask away I'll say
<|endoftext|>

My husband still doesn't
 call when we're apart I just
wish he wouldn't talk
<|endoftext|>

Just got back from a
 two day trip overseas so
that should be a success
<|endoftext|>

i think i might
 be a bad person but fuck
why do i do shit
<|endoftext|>

Anyone remember
 the first song of A Moon
In the Sum of Everything
<|endoftext|>

i just finished a
 full day of work and my body
naps don't feel right
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe I'm
 a parent and not a teacher
But I'm a teacher
<|endoftext|>

I wonder where the
 children will sleep tonight so
many are up late
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe she's
 actually doing all her
thing to be a celebrity
<|endoftext|>

I need a baby
 I don't want any but I'm
in the process of it
<|endoftext|>

I would go back
 to my old ways if that wasn't
a lie I've been warned
<|endoftext|>

Not long after that
 picture where she's being attacked
the girls are being attacked
<|endoftext|>

my brother and i
 went back for a second date
what's the difference
<|endoftext|>

It's amazing the
 patience we have when we come
for such things and we fail
<|endoftext|>

if i would've known
 how to tell her i would've stopped
her to be here more
<|endoftext|>

I hate thinking how
 this is happening for you guys
and that sucks too bad
<|endoftext|>

I've heard you're from
 a little blue suburb now
Gabe you must not be
<|endoftext|>

Ain't no place like
 heaven to be with love and peace
And don't be afraid
<|endoftext|>

This morning I just
 heard it was Christmas morning and
it just killed me
<|endoftext|>

People who listen
 get sick to their stomachs
I hate that shit lol
<|endoftext|>

i just want to sleep
 I need to sleep so much
it's so depressing
<|endoftext|>

Never ever give
 up don't let the demons get you
worse than them lol
<|endoftext|

Good for them to take
 their time while they're waiting for
a shot with me lol
<|endoftext|>

So many girls I
 look up to but I won't go
to school with u me
<|endoftext|>

How would a boy do
 his homework and then he gets
an appointment
<|endoftext|>

if someone were to
 come at me with a knife
I would just swat them
<|endoftext|>

People come in and
 do whatever the hell
they want just because
<|endoftext|>

I'm really enjoying
 this trip out with my family
because I do not

I think my parents
 both really tired of
me being angry
<|endoftext|>

 tired and sleepy I'll get
up and run to the gym

The music's the only
 thing that drives me right now
Why does it matter
<|endoftext|>

 only one that thinks i look
like the girl in the

 this shit cause its been a long
week day lol fuck

 is keeping me awake at
night is the sound

 the rain has not let up on me
this far lol how many

the weather or my
<|endoftext|>

I hate people who
 think a person with a
big heart is mean or a
<|endoftext|>

I'm tired of the
 same shit all the time I'm tired
of living in shits
<|endoftext|>

What do the hell do

put their lips in someone
<|endoftext|>

So does the government

say it is a day

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the
people are the same
<|endoftext|>

if i wanna talk
 to you im gonna talk to
you i wanna know
<|endoftext|>

People who want to
 die don't give a shit about
their pasts Why they don't
<|endoftext|>

If you're from a country
 that don't have the S flag then
you don't belong here
<|endoftext|>

Curious why this
 shit is popping but the
same people keep coming
<|endoftext|>

So far the only
 things I've noticed are the people
in the store and the man
<|endoftext|>

This is what happens
 when you forget a thing you
thought was important
<|endoftext|>

If the sky is blue
 and not purple then I'm blue
and not purple lol
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired of
 the stupid shit I get
in my phone It's awful
<|endoftext|>

Selling myself as
 beautiful is not the truth
and I'm not your girl
<|endoftext|>

This time yesterday
 I didn't really look at
any photos but this
<|endoftext|>

I know I'm not you
 that you know the way I feel
But I know you're not me
<|endoftext|>

It's not hard to
 not think but I can never
be the person I'd like
<|endoftext|>

The feeling of someone
 getting on your nerves can burn
on you forever
<|endoftext|>

I only got a
 single ear that I got from
hospice i can't be
<|endoftext|>

I'm having nightmares
 about my friends that I love
so much but never
<|endoftext|>

Why people are so
 quick to judge me because I'm
good but not perfect
<|endoftext|>

My body won't work
 the hard way I'm gonna be
grateful for my life
<|endoftext|>

I always hear people
 saying they don't like you and
I always think im
<|endoftext|>

I always have to
 listen to the radio while
I'm watching tv it's
<|endoftext|>

i'd rather my hair
 than be shaven I'm too fat
to be shaven lol
<|endoftext|>

If you're not feeling
 like going somewhere it's fine
to stay home and play
<|endoftext|>

People that take so
 long to respond to texts aren't
going to leave so
<|endoftext|>

The only thing better
 than being in love is to
be the owner
<|endoftext|>

I'm sorry you feel
 that way you should just call me back
I'm going to work
<|endoftext|>

Sleeping with a
 headache because someone
doesn't let you sleep
<|endoftext|>

No more crying
 because I have enough tears
right now to feed my cats
<|endoftext|>

It's the perfect
 time for me and I'm so ready
for her in my life
<|endoftext|>

He needs a man who
 can get up early to
work and never get up
<|endoftext|>

We should have had an
 ice cream delivery man
instead of a truck
<|endoftext|>

A woman who gets
 up early is a rare breed
not in the typical
<|endoftext|>

i don't want to eat
 anything you can't find on
the menu or a
<|endoftext|>

I can't remember
 the last time i even smoked
a weed i was there
<|endoftext|>

People really don't
 care why you are here so I
don't remember right
<|endoftext|>

We're going to see
 a lot of people in
this election
<|endoftext|>

It's okay to be
 angry sometimes when somebody
uselessly hurt you
<|endoftext|>

The biggest fear in
 life is that you won't be
around for the long
<|endoftext|>

A lot of people
 should come clean and apologize
for all the shit they
<|endoftext|>

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
everything and everything
<|endoftext|>

It's not about you in
 the end it's about how you
deal with it in life
<|endoftext|>

The first video
 is a success and the next
one is more like a
<|endoftext|>

Lol i don't wanna
 talk about it yet but its on
the screen again
<|endoftext|>

I love my life its
 so good for someone else how
much do i lose tho
<|endoftext|>

I always wanna
 see me so i never get
to see u yet lol
<|endoftext|>

I haven't stopped being
 surprised my whole life cause I
just never understand
<|endoftext|>

if i'm gonna make
 money and you're the only
one I will have a fuck
<|endoftext|>

Came around the sun
 and it was too fucking late
for a damn sun
<|endoftext|>

I don't believe in
 miracles but if only
God wanted to do something
<|endoftext|>

i'm getting pretty
 used to seeing women on
twitter right now lol
<|endoftext|>

Catch the movie on
 Netflix or Stream with the
internet still on
<|endoftext|>

this is a stupid
 idea to put a bullet
in a bottle
<|endoftext|>

No one ever said
 you were perfect no one said
you were not special
<|endoftext|>

I swear no one ever
 will be allowed to tell you
about your ass
<|endoftext|>

i always get stuck
 in the middle and end up
making shit up lol
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you just gotta
 trust in the people you know
You got me right now
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes when your hair
 is starting to dry you need
to go to the doctor
<|endoftext|>

i'm a complete mess
 but today is a good day
for me i love it
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you gotta
 be able to trust that something
are going to fall
<|endoftext|>

I got no real boyfriend
 and I'm fine but I'd rather
have this ass manfriend over
<|endoftext|>

So far all of our
 tickets are sold out and we have
not even gotten back to
<|endoftext|>

i just wanna go
 to the beach so i can just cry
the whole time i feel
<|endoftext|>

I really need to
 get these shoes so i can go
back on twitter i
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired of
 being bullied and always
having to fix shit
<|endoftext|>

you should check out my
 youtube channel for tips
and tricks to have nice hair
<|endoftext|>

When people talk about
 a person as if they're not
there just be a lie
<|endoftext|>

There's a man who just
 doesn't exist He only
gives you the space to
<|endoftext|>

Don't forget one last
 thing don't look at this clock
like a joke or a
<|endoftext|>

i'll be going to
 the gym today i can't wait
for my gym time right
<|endoftext|>

I think being on
 Twitter helped a lot with
all my work needs now
<|endoftext|>

I'm so excited
 for my friends and this is the
perfect excuse to
<|endoftext|>

When people try to
 tell you what to do for them
their heads hurt so bad
<|endoftext|>

This is such a great
 idea and I hope you
get around to it
<|endoftext|>

When a boy says you
 made him feel good and you
said you could be him
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes things happen
 too fast it's so weird and you
don't know what to do
<|endoftext|>

The more I talk to
 the more I realize that
it didn't all come from
<|endoftext|>

Not even trying
 to be rude and talk shit to
a kid this is great
<|endoftext|>

My parents will be

<|endoftext|>

A real person is
 not someone who acts like
a piece of ass
<|endoftext|>

If you're not proud of
 your accomplishments you'll do
a better job after
<|endoftext|>

It's funny when
 people ask me questions and
it ends in
<|endoftext|>

the person who is
 the most annoying has
a really good brain
<|endoftext|>

I get nervous at
 the thought of coming home it
hurt my mood so bad
<|endoftext|>

My daughter just told
 me her dad is really cute
her dad was so weird
<|endoftext|>

You're not a real
 person because it's easy for
us to tell it's you
<|endoftext|>

Can someone explain
 me how I should live my life
in order not to die
<|endoftext|>

How is my car

Won't ever look
 back on this night for a second
since last year yay
<|endoftext|>

I got so much going
 on my life right now but I'm
just ready to go
<|endoftext|>

I really need to
 find someone for a long term
partner to support me
<|endoftext|>

I'm feeling really
 lucky to have a man like
your friend today thank
<|endoftext|>

Just woke up to
 this It's a beautiful piece
of music by Taylor Swift

 things about you the worst
thing they can do is say

People that can't say
 much are only good in a
way that doesn't mean much
<|endoftext|>

======== SAMPLE 1 ========


I'm not even gonna
 try to hide any kind of
happiness
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you just have too
 much to do and you think everything
is going to be fine
<|endoftext|>

If you get to the
 end of this month it's going
to be time to eat
<|endoftext|>

Criminals are the
 worst I don't want to be with
one of them bitch
<|endoftext|>

I'm just an ordinary
 person in the grand scheme I
don't know how to feel
<|endoftext|>

I was told my mom
 will be gone for a while and
all I need now is
<|endoftext|>

If it's possible
 to have nothing more than what
you have then you're ready
<|endoftext|>

I think I'm getting
 a bit sleepy but i need
one to wake up in
<|endoftext|>

I've never had a
 person who looked me in
the eye say all that
<|endoftext|>

You gonna remember
 how it feels to be so drunk
and you feel you're dead
<|endoftext|>

I really hate watching
 this bitch come get me when
I try to hang up
<|endoftext|>

The only thing worse
 is a person trying to
turn themselves to you
<|endoftext|>

A lot of people
 thought I was joking but I
had a crush right there
<|endoftext|>

I need a couple
 of new things to get me through
the first few days of
<|endoftext|>

I always look at
 things like that like it's some
crazy dream But no
<|endoftext|>

I'm really not feeling
 the same tonight I'm not
feeling that good now
<|endoftext|>

I'm not sure how that
 helps me live but it does
make me feel better
<|endoftext|>

Some people need to
 make the right choices because
it's their livelihood
<|endoftext|>

i'm sorry but this
 really isn't funny and
you know it's dumb lol
<|endoftext|>

It's always easier
 to do it the right way to
make money and sleep
<|endoftext|>

I'm going on a
 drive today and this is so
much fun I can't wait
<|endoftext|>

Glad things have finally
 been fixed for the next week and
I'm tired of it
<|endoftext|>

You have no real power
 without the other peoples
favourite things of yours
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes I wish we
 knew each other before we
got our hair done in a
<|endoftext|>

It makes me really
 mad that everyone seems to
never change even
<|endoftext|>

The only thing that
 makes me laugh better than a
shitpost is when you die
<|endoftext|>

It's not the season
 of the young lady you have
no clue what you have
<|endoftext|>

Somebody that's
 got me going to make me
a big hit tomorrow
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to try
 this weekend and see what I
can think of next month
<|endoftext|>

I love how much of
 you are in a single moment
as is the rest
<|endoftext|>

The fact I haven't
 done a one on one in
a while I just keep them
<|endoftext|>

All I want for Christmas
 break is Christmas parties
and a new car
<|endoftext|>

I always go and
 talk to people that's why i
think of them when I
<|endoftext|>

Amber Rose is
 so damn hot but the most
talent the cast
<|endoftext|>

i still don't get why
 people would stay up at night
for shit i don't understand
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna be making
 all of my lunches today
to get back to the
<|endoftext|>

i'll be honest with
 you i feel like an asshole
this isn't good news
<|endoftext|>

endoftext|>

If someone don't
 do a damn thing for you then
you don't deserve them
<|endoftext|>

Crazy how things happen
 and you just know you wouldnt
worse to be wrong
<|endoftext|>

Just wanted to be
 home and watch some movies with
my baby so bad
<|endoftext|>

The person you love
 the most you must hold the most
close to you always
<|endoftext|>

my dad was on
 my tinder today and i
love him so much i'm
<|endoftext|>

I'm never gonna
 be the same in my life but
it's only a week
<|endoftext|>

When you're the only
 person I ever love
then your heart will burst
<|endoftext|>

Why is someone
 always telling the truth I
just don't see it
<|endoftext|>

I'm excited to
 finally see a real game
today I'm so happy
<|endoftext|>

I'll always put out
 something good and it'll be a
little gift from The
<|endoftext|>

Just because my mom
 was never in your life
doesn't make me bad
<|endoftext|>

Don't forget to eat
 good food like a good steak like
a good steak the right
<|endoftext|>

the greatest thing about
 being single is you'll never
be bored again
<|endoftext|>

Good morning I'm a
 happy person today I need
a little more than
<|endoftext|>

If you gonna see
 me be happy it will be
on your next flight to hell
<|endoftext|>

That sounds like a
 good day to me Good evening
I love you Happy
<|endoftext|>

Y'all always want to
 come out and say shit that has
no truth in it at all
<|endoftext|>

i really wish i
 could be the only one in
that room with you lol
<|endoftext|>

If anyone can
 help me get a nice sweater
for Christmas I'm happy
<|endoftext|>

I have so much more
 energy now and I'm so
happy with this
<|endoftext|>

When someone makes you
 happy then you are a lot
less likely to make
<|endoftext|>

There is one other
 person that has to play on
this game tonight so
<|endoftext|>

You shouldn't do anything
 except love those who love
you and care about
<|endoftext|>

I hate how people
 get mad when you change in the
wrong ways lol ill die
<|endoftext|>

I need something to
 do today I think I be
getting some dinner
<|endoftext|>

I'm always waiting
 for that moment That moment
if there's another
<|endoftext|>

No matter what's happened
 I feel that something better
will come next time
<|endoftext|>

That's all i can say
 I hate everyone I love
everyone I just
<|endoftext|>

Happiness is the
 biggest motivator we
all need is time to
<|endoftext|>

If your a dog you
 need to get a life like a
human being
<|endoftext|>

Hearing a siren
 is my way of reminding
me when i get home
<|endoftext|>

So you're not telling
 me this is a joke if it
is you know best lol
<|endoftext|>

I have a problem
 with my stomach I'm so upset
that I can't eat
<|endoftext|>

If nothing else you
 are the queen of the universe
I just really need
<|endoftext|>

Goodmorning I always
 wake up to white guys I love
myself but not them
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna go to
 sleep and I'm not going to
wake up until it's
<|endoftext|>

When you're mad you always
 end up regretting it because
you were so stupid
<|endoftext|>

This really does make
 me feel so good I don't want
to go out tonight

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 your first
picture of your friends
<|endoftext|>

I'm in this stupid
 mood I know where the money
is at But we can't
<|endoftext|>

That's exactly what
 we're calling the people who give
hormone free norethindole
<|endoftext|>

You just don't understand
 why people act like they care
to me anymore
<|endoftext|>

I'm about to go
 off and do laundry and I'm
about to give up
<|endoftext|>

Haven't ever met
 a person so happy with
what they feel inside
<|endoftext|>

I know people who
 can do that but they're too afraid
to do it for them
<|endoftext|>

i wish i had something
 to do after school the only
thing i have is time
<|endoftext|>

I think my brain is
 just a little too tired
and sick to be asleep
<|endoftext|>

It's not about whether
 you love me or you won't love
me anymore it's
<|endoftext|>

When I walk into
 the shower I turn off the
headlight on my way
<|endoftext|>

I'm sorry but I
 do not wish to make this game
for less than you need
<|endoftext|>

I want a job and
 a living hell because of
me and no one else
<|endoftext|>

The most exciting
 thing about me is that I
can run at any
<|endoftext|>

I'm not going to
 be surprised if you won't
let me have a day
<|endoftext|>

What a blessing to
 experience a moment
you weren't aware
<|endoftext|>

I'm sorry that's the
 way it is but it's the way
I feel with to be
<|endoftext|>

I have a question
 and it will stay here Until we
have to talk Again
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired but
 I love eating so much and
my diet is working
<|endoftext|>

You should be writing
 like a voodoo doll in love
and not a mook
<|endoftext|>

I hate working at
 two jobs but I could do
myself at one
<|endoftext|>

my hair color has
 ruined the quality
of my life again
<|endoftext|>

Some people just make
 fun of you for what they should
get a life for
<|endoftext|>

If it's not for her
 it's for you and your friends
not your parents LOL
<|endoftext|>

Happiness is not
 a choice it's an attitude
and a heart
<|endoftext|>

We are the best
 in many countries but it's
not real when I eat
<|endoftext|>

I swear we just had
 a conversation in the
crib on the morning of
<|endoftext|>

I wanna take the
 morning I need a new day
to go to heaven
<|endoftext|>

I'm about to have
 the worst Sunday ever
I can do better
<|endoftext|>

So is calling somebody
 or saying you love somebody
a hate on the tip
<|endoftext|>

I just want to go
 to her apartment I have
too much shit to do
<|endoftext|>

I've wanted to go out
 but haven't wanted a long
time I'm really not
<|endoftext|>

I'll be so happy
 you can show your support to
Me and my friends
<|endoftext|>

A perfect day to
 just get away like I do
and have a cold
<|endoftext|>

The first time we got
 up early this year for work
is where the stress comes
<|endoftext|>

I've never been more
 happy in my entire
life in my entire
<|endoftext|>

The whole world I thought
 about it today I mean
I just have some faith
<|endoftext|>

Swingers are such
 annoying I miss them in
the same way I do
<|endoftext|>

Gotta love having

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 get you the right answer
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna put off
 a bit to see what can be
done to my hair
<|endoftext|>

the fact that you say
 I make you cry makes me feel
more than justified
<|endoftext|>

So the first question
 I ask myself is do I really
think I could do it
<|endoftext|>

I had a fever and
 I haven't had my headache
since Friday tonight
<|endoftext|>

It's impossible to
 be so focused you do
not allow yourself to
<|endoftext|>

So they just came in
 and said you're welcome they love
you and they're here for
<|endoftext|>

Can you believe this
 stupid asshole tried and went
into rehab today
<|endoftext|>

I'll always be in
 love with a place It's too bad
that I can't touch it
<|endoftext|>

I'll always be grateful
 for a friend that leaves you some
how Just be patient
<|endoftext|>

Somebody asked me
 a crazy question and I
had no clue what he said
<|endoftext|>

I always get into
 arguments with my father
Who's the fave right now
<|endoftext|>

This year I'm getting
 a really big job at my
college and it's crazy
<|endoftext|>

My phone died so
 many times today It's okay
to cry and move on
<|endoftext|>

You only get one
 chance in life and God is the
one who gave you that one
<|endoftext|>

I'm not about
 money I love the people
in my life and my life
<|endoftext|>

I was worried that
 someone might come and get me
after all this time
<|endoftext|>

It's not only the
 first week of class but the first
week of November too
<|endoftext|>

Good morning Happy
 Saturday to you and God bless
you all on this lovely
<|endoftext|>

I gotta go to
 work this next Saturday I'm
so exhausted lol
<|endoftext|>

The moment the sun
 goes down the water's gone
good night baby boy
<|endoftext|>

I really don't want
 it be the week just yet I
want it at least once
<|endoftext|>

How do you go through
 it You start over You don't
just stop It won't work
<|endoftext|>

I want something so
 much I wanna be able
to hold on to it
<|endoftext|>

Don't waste your time
 asking for the next meal ask
for the one before
<|endoftext|>

I love playing games
 with my nephew he is so
little yet so strong
<|endoftext|>

I'm just going to
 say it I don't get drunk like
I used to do lol
<|endoftext|>

It feels weird not
 being able to walk away
from the house today
<|endoftext|>

It always reminds
 me how fucked up life really
is and what a dick
<|endoftext|>

I'm feeling so down
 lately but damn I guess
I love myself lol
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe people
 are still reading this on this
day of reckoning yikes
<|endoftext|>

I'm the only
 person I love watching sleep
with the cats at the theater
<|endoftext|>

I'm so happy I
 had the opportunity to
get myself in this
<|endoftext|>

My boyfriend bought me
 a dress I can't wait to wear
it I can't even
<|endoftext|>

I'm so hungry and
 tired of talking shit
about myself I'm over
<|endoftext|>

I'm just gonna do
 everything to get my life
back to normal now
<|endoftext|>

I'm not gonna lie
 I think this chick is so gay
that I don't mind it
<|endoftext|>

You always have someone
 better that have them but you
don't know them like that
<|endoftext|>

I

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
endoftext|>

If you get up that
 early I promise you'll want one
more to be the first
<|endoftext|>

It was just so fucking
 crazy seeing me here being
ready to leave by the
<|endoftext|>

I'll be so shocked if it
 doesn't lead to him making
more money lol thanks guys
<|endoftext|>

The only thing I've
 been able to do is get
this song all the way out
<|endoftext|>

The only thing I
 like more than myself is to
see people's face it
<|endoftext|>

I've been thinking about
 it the entirety of the
first few nights of
<|endoftext|>

Can't believe the same
 story can only be told in
a completely different
<|endoftext|>

Can someone explain to
 me why I need to be around
this many dudes at
<|endoftext|>

The most important
 point is that we must never
ever allow a wall
<|endoftext|>

I'm getting really
 high with this feeling in my
chest I'm so content
<|endoftext|>

I'm very sorry but
 its hard to believe people
pretend to be nice lol
<|endoftext|>

And this isn't about
 some petty shit I just want
to say some things
<|endoftext|>

Losing a brother
 so small really hurts the most
It's always so sweet
<|endoftext|>

Ya I was joking
 at both and I wasn't kidding
or joking at all
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe I'm
 being so serious about
a guy that loves me
<|endoftext|>

The only way out
 of the tunnel is out the
tunnel so far away
<|endoftext|>

I wanna go on
 the date with my parents but
they can't wait until
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes I feel like
 I still have people who
would give my life the
<|endoftext|>

The only song I
 listen to the most is the
same as always I guess
<|endoftext|>

What we have to look
 forward to is nothing but the
dreadful apocalypse
<|endoftext|>

How many minutes
 will the new season be
in effect tonight
<|endoftext|>

I wonder if they
 can be together without
the man in a mask
<|endoftext|>

Never leave anyone
 who you used to go to high
school with behind
<|endoftext|>

It is only the
 best when a child is there with
you at all times
<|endoftext|>

My whole outlook on
 life has changed and I wish that
had to happen more
<|endoftext|>

I want a boyfriend
 that understands that this is
my life and he should
<|endoftext|>

Aye I just did it
 for myself and I'm so grateful
and so grateful to
<|endoftext|>

My dog is acting
 like a baby so I'm starting
his puppy naps now
<|endoftext|>

Gotta get the job
 filled by the most qualified
people possible
<|endoftext|>

you can't have one in
 high school or you are gonna be
one of those people
<|endoftext|>

Woke today and I'm
 ready to give love a try
and try it once more
<|endoftext|>

i'm ready to move
 back to los angeles and quit
everything about me
<|endoftext|>

It wouldn't be fair
 if she was still able to
take pictures of me
<|endoftext|>

I wish I knew the
 best way to get some peace out
of a bad day or
<|endoftext|>

The way that some people
 talk and talk and talk is not
appropriate
<|endoftext|>

Why are you always
 asking me if I can still
pay my rent for next month
<|endoftext|>

the only thing i
 like about you is that you
are cute y'all I'm a
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to be
 the biggest fucking pussy
in ur body tomorrow

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a baby's first
day at school
<|endoftext|>

All I have to do
 is look them in the eyes and
they know something's up
<|endoftext|>

I wanna live with
 my own man but i don't have
the energy
<|endoftext|>

You ever feel like
 you can't go to the gym
for three weeks straight
<|endoftext|>

Lets face it that's the
 best day for those of you
who think they get a break
<|endoftext|>

Amen You better not
 get a concussion Just
get another day
<|endoftext|>

the whole world will love
 my song and my video
is amazing thank
<|endoftext|>

What a difference a
 few days can make in my mood
and outlook on life
<|endoftext|>

Amen To me I
 need to get some fresh paint
and polish I need it
<|endoftext|>

I have a bad feeling
 about this and my health will
be put at risk
<|endoftext|>

How come he gets no
 points when everyone is
talking him out
<|endoftext|>

That last minute change
 in the dress for the party
in the airport is
<|endoftext|>

I really have the
 happiest life ever i
have a big heart
<|endoftext|>

I need a long weekend
 to myself to think a long
long time about life
<|endoftext|>

The whole world's gonna
 know after the first two days
of September wow lol
<|endoftext|>

Gotta go back and
 start over I'm not ready
for this shit anymore
<|endoftext|>

I'm tired and can't
 wait until I fall asleep and
wake up to some more
<|endoftext|>

Happy holidays
 to you all I hope you all have
the best Christmas ever
<|endoftext|>

Gotta work some stuff
 out because I'm not the best and
you all know I'm right
<|endoftext|>

my boyfriend said he
 loves me and i wanna know
what that means so it
<|endoftext|>

i'm going to love
 this so much and i really
wanna have him home
<|endoftext|>

Never been so tired
 or happy to be in bed
for the rest of the
<|endoftext|>

I remember when
 i started taking advs and
it was a blast lol
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna have to get
 my nails done this weekend and
I'm not feeling it
<|endoftext|>

You will NEVER have
 the right to yell at me all
night I will always
<|endoftext|>

I wanna know if
 y'all wanna drop by for a
stunning birthday cake
<|endoftext|>

I hate working out
 without lifting and in the
afternoon my whole body
<|endoftext|>

And then you'll be in
 the club playing golf as they
just finished last year
<|endoftext|>

What's the first place you
 think that my name will be on
the list and not me
<|endoftext|>

You should only use
 the word when people would
use the word wrong lol
<|endoftext|>

The best part is she
 got one on me I'm still not
over so I can't
<|endoftext|>

You really just need
 to stop taking my calls when
your phone dies so sorry
<|endoftext|>

When the person you're
 with doesn't have a car they
need to buy one themselves
<|endoftext|>

You guys are better
 than all the other people
in the world You should
<|endoftext|>

I really have never
 seen you act this bad in my
life It's so embarrassing
<|endoftext|>

That's what you get for
 being a dumb ass in front
of my little brother
<|endoftext|>

my stomach feels so
 good and like all my energy
will be put to use
<|endoftext|>

My heart beats like a
 hurricane is ready to
breathe Its so strong
<|endoftext|

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I feel better
<|endoftext|>

Watched the new Star Wars
 trailer and it was so dope
WANTED LOST IN LOVE
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired i'm
 not going to go to class
this Friday lol
<|endoftext|>

A lot of people
 are coming and going I
don't wanna leave y'all
<|endoftext|>

You wanna see a
 person and they look so sweet
but they're sad too ugh
<|endoftext|>

Cindy I need to
 tell her I'm here to support
her and take care of
<|endoftext|>

I haven't read the
 damn thing yet but it really
means more than most
<|endoftext|>

Don't get me off your
 business people who don't have
your best interests in
<|endoftext|>

When they got their man
 it was like it was going
to be a party
<|endoftext|>

And the man's like w
 do u see him I don't have
to see him too much
<|endoftext|>

You gonna regret
 it you ain't seen what I'm going
through right now bro
<|endoftext|>

It's going to be
 a nice day at the beach with
all the sunbeams on
<|endoftext|>

Just because this has
 gone away to another
day does not mean I'm
<|endoftext|>

The reason why my
 hair grew back twice as much
as the other days
<|endoftext|>

That's one of my new
 favorite memes Why is everyone
talking about it
<|endoftext|>

Not a lot of other
 people on monday so I'm
not too busy lol
<|endoftext|>

A woman who had
 a hard time finding someone to
love is really weak
<|endoftext|>

We're gonna have the
 same dreams because I'm so tired
and tired so damn
<|endoftext|>

It's a blessing to
 have someone who understands
how things work and love
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna go to
 my sister's house tonight so
I can cry her eyes out
<|endoftext|>

A week of playing
 the rest of the weekend is
over I'm bored tho
<|endoftext|>

How can someone call
 out his parents for being so
overpaid i'm pissed
<|endoftext|>

Woke up really hungry
 and I already ate all
my food on the way
<|endoftext|>

i'll never watch the
 next chapter of mister and
josh ever again
<|endoftext|>

It is nice to be
 so close, yet so separated from
everyone I know
<|endoftext|>

Y'all ever met the
 best rapper ever you should
be writing it down
<|endoftext|>

I'm going home to
 make it rain tomorrow and
try to play some football
<|endoftext|>

i'm looking forward
 to getting home to eat and
drink and watch football
<|endoftext|>

I hope everyone
 is having a great weekend
I'm proud and happy
<|endoftext|>

Took off to school this
 evening and had to take a
snack or two today
<|endoftext|>

When I'm depressed I
 think about how everyone
is going out
<|endoftext|>

You are my sunshine
 a wonderful human
a precious one
<|endoftext|>

My cousin really
 wants to go see the movie
the final battle
<|endoftext|>

Someone give me a
 free drink at a movie now
I got no choice lol
<|endoftext|>

I'll never go out
 on a weekend that's just not
right for me at all
<|endoftext|>

the world is changing
 and i have nowhere to go
but up in my eyes
<|endoftext|>

Gimme your phone and
 tell me your real name so we
can talk about it
<|endoftext|>

We don't even know
 what we got until we start
to buy something
<|endoftext|>

oftext|>

My dream isn't to
 sleep until I get a job
so I just wake up
<|endoftext|>

I've never listened
 to a beat this old I miss
the days when u sing
<|endoftext|>

I wish someone who
 would let me have these babies
would help please let me
<|endoftext|>

I don't know about
 you but this is pretty damn
great I wish it would
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna be
 left alone and do nothing
is that too much
<|endoftext|>

I can never be
 my favorite thing but I'm
always doing that
<|endoftext|>

I'm never gonna
 forget that day the best
of our relationship
<|endoftext|>

I want some meat I
 want it fast and I want it
fresher and better
<|endoftext|>

My best friends are the
 only things that I can use
to hold me over
<|endoftext|>

i'm really not into
 anything like this anymore
its just too much lol
<|endoftext|>

I've never been as
 lazy to do something like
as someone as dumb
<|endoftext|>

It's very important
 to always show who you are
and what you want n
<|endoftext|>

I love how easily
 a stupid question can go
a thousand directions
<|endoftext|>

I have an appointment
 to go to the dentist this
Monday I'll let you
<|endoftext|>

You really do have
 nothing to worry about if
you've been following
<|endoftext|>

I'm so glad I have
 more than just my brother I
would've lost everything
<|endoftext|>

I really need to
 get the new album ready
so I can buy it
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to make
 my birthday plans and I'm very
happy about that
<|endoftext|>

I'm so sorry to
 anyone that has been at
this same loss for awhile
<|endoftext|>

It's like I'm too big
 and too strong for the things I
want to do with myself
<|endoftext|>

I think it just is
 that I know I'm not going to
be able to fix it
<|endoftext|>

If u gotta be
 with me in the night I'll not see
U till u wake up
<|endoftext|>

I'm not even gonna
 bother talking on the phone
I just want to text
<|endoftext|>

I'm not sure who did
 it but somebody on Twitter
did it really well
<|endoftext|>

That's the whole plan and
 I'm not even surprised it
isn't working out
<|endoftext|>

A friend in the office
 has no friends he has no friends
so my plan is wrong
<|endoftext|>

this is fucking stupid
 i just wanna get high as
an adult and sleep
<|endoftext|>

I just found out that
 my baby is being raised
in christmas I'm scared
<|endoftext|>

i gotta figure
 shit out on my phone first or
i will be in jail
<|endoftext|>

I was supposed to
 get my nails done next Wednesday
and now I don't feel
<|endoftext|>

No matter who I
 am or what I put my mind
to I can't be like
<|endoftext|>

My heart is not the
 kind of heart that's willing and
able to stand on ends
<|endoftext|>

I really have this
 hard time with not asking for
anything in return
<|endoftext|>

i'm so nervous for
 the new album cause im not
all that sure about this
<|endoftext|>

I hate my boyfriend
 So I hate my self Oh God
I'm so sad tonight
<|endoftext|>

I'll be taking the
 bus to the train station at
the crack of dawn today
<|endoftext|>

Do not be so quick to
 say that you are ready for
something to be done
<|endoftext|>

When it comes to a
 friend

|endoftext|>

And I'm ready to
 go to sleep That's all the
weirdness I need to
<|endoftext|>

That's what I love about
 everything i love that feeling
but that never leaves
<|endoftext|>

Dumbest woman on
 the planet I say bye bye
and move on that bitch
<|endoftext|>

I wanna get married
 today but I have to go
to church today too
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes it's just a
 thing not to do the other
things that come around
<|endoftext|>

Just waiting to be
 home for the first time with my
family so I can
<|endoftext|>

This is the kind that
 has your stomach so turned on
it just needs to be
<|endoftext|>

The only person
 I worry about in my
life is my grandma
<|endoftext|>

I really hate the
 little white blighters that come
with your coffee M
<|endoftext|>

When someone thinks they
 love you they will always have
that person in their
<|endoftext|>

Why do some guys get
 so mad when girls say they want
to have kids No way
<|endoftext|>

There are few things I feel
 better than when my friend says
he likes me on Twitter
<|endoftext|>

My birthday is in
 a few days and I got some
new toys for it
<|endoftext|>

You are nothing but
 a stupid bitch who cannot
walk away from it
<|endoftext|>

What happened to those
 people who loved you before
that it was all over
<|endoftext|>

Can I ever get
 married to an artist
on the same level
<|endoftext|>

It really fucking
 hurt when you get that feeling
in your throat when you
<|endoftext|>

I've lived a dream life
 but I'll miss all the people
that are gonna love
<|endoftext|>

I was going through
 the motions of eating and
making breakfast but
<|endoftext|>

Never thought I'd be
 able to feel anything
of the kind this time
<|endoftext|>

I can only give
 this shit up so I can get
it done right away
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to be
 spending most of the day at a
super store with my
<|endoftext|>

So the people who
 hate me cause I give them my
last few words or don't
<|endoftext|>

WILLIAMSON AND HUBBARD
 FOUND THE TEXAS LAB ON STAGE
WHILE BANNING BILL SAGEN
<|endoftext|>

I really just can't
 wait for the summer so I
can do all my schoolwork
<|endoftext|>

I should've known I'd
 be falling in love with the
muse that same day LOL
<|endoftext|>

This is the worst case
 scenario for my school
the only ones who don't
<|endoftext|>

My biggest fear is
 that someone might think u don't
mean what u say LOL
<|endoftext|>

Just finished watching
 Red Dawn and it was my
stop in a while lol
<|endoftext|>

I would never let
 them take away your right
to protest peacefully
<|endoftext|>

I just realized
 everyone on here is dead
I want to move on
<|endoftext|>

I wish I could sit
 down and just make dinner for
myself for the week
<|endoftext|>

Why don't y'all ever
 just have an honest conversation
about things I hate
<|endoftext|>

I have so many
 good friends I wish they all could
join a band now lol
<|endoftext|>

My heart is really
 beating so fast I feel like
I'm about to fall
<|endoftext|>

I really only
 come home to this house for two
days a week at least
<|endoftext|>

I would have never
 thought I got my hair cut by
you in the first place
<|endoftext|>

I'm so close to
 my brother I miss him so
much he's the only
<|endoftext|>

Just because you don't
 feel things doesn't mean you
have the whole truth
<|endoftext|>

It is illegal
 for you to make someone feel
disrespected lol I
<|endoftext|>

my heart is so broken
 i almost broke the seal but
its so much better
<|endoftext|>

you wanna have them
 but I don't wanna have you
unless you feel the same
<|endoftext|>

Can somebody help
 me with a question that's on
my mind I'm scared shit
<|endoftext|>

What did you mean to
 ask my husband for a job
applying on my phone
<|endoftext|>

I'm so jealous of
 all the people who come in
and help out other girls
<|endoftext|>

my brother used to
 be such a sweet dude He
used to give me a
<|endoftext|>

It's been a while since
 I last watched A Hologram
for the Memories
<|endoftext|>

I hate to see you
 get kicked out of my life but
it's your own damn fault
<|endoftext|>

My brother just told
 me that he's going to marry
someone I think that
<|endoftext|>

I've never been more
 bummed off in my life than
this right now Fuck this
<|endoftext|>

Gonna be my last
 day and I don't want that to
waste it on a drink
<|endoftext|>

If you're looking for
 someone who can entertain
you and your group then
<|endoftext|>

All of the kids say
 they be having fun but in
truth they be having
<|endoftext|>

All I want for Christmas
 is your face I'll give all
my free time to you
<|endoftext|>

Ladies if you're not
 talking to his mum why the
hell are u girls lol

piece of ass in one
<|endoftext|>

 some new clothes for work and I
can't wait to get there
<|endoftext|>

I don't know why
 you can't play around You
are like the rock
<|endoftext|>

All good things must come
 to an end so let's hope
we get this one lol
<|endoftext|>

I want an elephant
 to watch my Instagram feed but
I don't have time
<|endoftext|>

I think he might have
 a little boy on him but
that's speculation
<|endoftext|>

i need to start taking
 notes and getting organized
before i start notes
<|endoftext|>

I just remembered
 that the game was cancelled in
England for tonight
<|endoftext|>

You could use The
 Greatest Showman in Japan
for this game in the
<|endoftext|>

I never even
 heard of a white supremacy
before you say that
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired yet
 so happy I'm gonna take
a nap for a while
<|endoftext|>

I'm always doing
 shit that I know isn't for
my own good so shit
<|endoftext|>

So many little
 miracles happen these days
I can't handle it
<|endoftext|>

i wonder if i
 ever should do something but
no you don't have to
<|endoftext|>

Gemini's got the worst
 food in the country and the
worst music I'll cry
<|endoftext|>

i would rather watch
 him take his hair out than
be in this situation
<|endoftext|>

I'm not a huge
 fan of talking to people at
least not without a pen

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 bitch
<|endoftext|>

you are so kind
 I can't resist doing anything
to make you happy
<|endoftext|>

Someday you will see
 the light I don't want any of
you to fail your test
<|endoftext|>

The weather is getting
 worse so I started packing
just in case it was
<|endoftext|>

It makes me so sad
 when people don't get over
you because of it
<|endoftext|>

No matter how much
 we talk you never understand
who you are before
<|endoftext|>

Can't believe that is
 the only time I'm going
to get yelled at lol
<|endoftext|>

Hats off to all the
 people that work all day at
these shops tonight
<|endoftext|>

I swear I always
 buy a gift for someone and
they're pissed at me haha
<|endoftext|>

Don't expect me to
 help you if you don't do it
yourself on your own
<|endoftext|>

It is said the devil
 always loves to hate the devil
just as much as you
<|endoftext|>

I think all kids are
 evil and we all need to
be told that it's okay
<|endoftext|>

Laughing through my tears
 I'm about to take a
tear in my eye I'm
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe what
 we've done in a couple of
months we'll be champions
<|endoftext|>

it's raining hard but
 the window sills are open
as we speak its okay
<|endoftext|>

If the moon is like
 a house of cards then the moon
is like a house of
<|endoftext|>

i wanna learn how
 to make ice cream and do it
like a pro like lol
<|endoftext|>

This is going to
 be the longest rant I've ever
heard in person LOL
<|endoftext|>

I hate how people
 never show you respect or
love you no matter what
<|endoftext|>

if you're gonna go
 to the bathroom be sure you
stay after they have
<|endoftext|>

I really want a
 big dick but don't want to be
a little boy anymore
<|endoftext|>

This really is what
 is on my mind It's either
a really good relationship
<|endoftext|>

Can't wait to turn up
 for the next session I'll find
something to do tonight
<|endoftext|>

I wanna have a
 big heart and really take it
to the grave tonight
<|endoftext|>

Never let anyone
 get you down Just make sure she
doesn't tell that shit
<|endoftext|>

People are so slow
 to accept and apologize
For being wrong too
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes it's better
 when you're drunk than when you're asleep
but I still like it
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna go to
 sleep so I can tweet about
the good things today
<|endoftext|>

I'm thinking about
 playing on the beach or beach
party in a couple
<|endoftext|>

When the weather's hot
 and everything in the mall
is breaking your legs
<|endoftext|>

It would be awesome
 to learn any English
words for a song please
<|endoftext|>

my mom really wanted
 me to go to my aunt
mother today so I
<|endoftext|>

I wanna know how
 to be a better mom and how
I still don't get it
<|endoftext|>

All those things I do
 to myself get in the way
of being happy
<|endoftext|>

I swear the only
 thing more annoying than a
jail time in prison
<|endoftext|>

This is gonna be
 a long afternoon but i have
much to do all at
<|endoftext|>

I wonder how much
 I'll be doing for the
mall at night after
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you just have
 to give up even if we
say no again lol
<|endoftext|>

 drawn
a giant squid
<|endoftext|>

And I'm in the hospital
 It's only Monday and I'm
in the hospital
<|endoftext|>

You are so generous
 and you're so funny we love
you so much too xox
<|endoftext|>

the internet is
 better than twitter but neither
of those are really close
<|endoftext|>

When the police show
 up and your car is towed it's
the greatest feeling
<|endoftext|>

Heard someone sing in
 school while my friends were playing
Bathtime in the house
<|endoftext|>

People are so good
 at what they do But are they
really so good at it
<|endoftext|>

Sometime i feel like
 my whole heart is in a freezer
i don't know what to
<|endoftext|>

You're going to get
 another chance but not till
you're ready To move
<|endoftext|>

I'm going to be
 there for you and you're going
to be there for me
<|endoftext|>

My first child is
 just about to be born I
loved it so much thank
<|endoftext|>

There have to be some
 better ways to treat people
like that than the present
<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna get all
 my tattoos done this weekend
and we could use some
<|endoftext|>

You know you're in
 for someone who can make you
smile just the other
<|endoftext|>

i just wanna thank
 mr. ruth for the ride my
puplets gave me today
<|endoftext|>

I like my body
 so damn much but this chick was
always so picky
<|endoftext|>

I'm so tired of
 fucking up your sleep I'm not
pregnant so fuck
<|endoftext|>

I'm always so full
 of shit when I just don't feel
well I need something
<|endoftext|>

I only ever
 end up hating myself at
the worst times when I'm
<|endoftext|>

If your momma got
 you the best birthday present
for her this year I'll
<|endoftext|>

My heart so full of
 love You really are so strong
and strong You're awesome
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes the people
 you love are the people who
make you laugh the most
<|endoftext|>

Why people say that
 I don't have the self control
to do my damn job
<|endoftext|>

I've been wanting to
 learn to play the trumpet
for months now I'm happy
<|endoftext|>

People will not like
 you until you can say who
you are and what you
<|endoftext|>

the only thing we
 are going to lose is the
power to choose
<|endoftext|>

Somebody just stole
 my makeup out of my house
and I don't like it
<|endoftext|>

This is not about
 politics this is not
about race this is
<|endoftext|>

My boyfriend gets mad
 whenever I have no energy
on the dance floor
<|endoftext|>

i wanna know the
 reason why my eyes got this
puffy thing back again
<|endoftext|>

If you really wanna
 be with someone you need to
be in love first fred
<|endoftext|>

I'm so sleepy but
 I'm so awake I'm ready
to wake up and go
<|endoftext|>

When your heart ain't made
 it up yet it's time to roll
Your heart you're so weak
<|endoftext|>

my heart is about
 to stop beating again and
I'm crying all of
<|endoftext|>

I really hope they
 go in the right direction
because they did right
<|endoftext|>

Somebody please buy
 me a hot tub so we can
have a really cool night
<|endoftext|>

i can't believe i
 waited so long for this so i
just remembered I
<|endoftext|>

A man can never
 have enough of me unless
i'm a prostitute

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 time
<|endoftext|>

I love the smell of
 coffee I love that smell
you just can't imagine
<|endoftext|>

My mom is gonna
 cry on the couch lol i bet
she's having a shit
<|endoftext|>

My biggest problem
 I always do is not being
in a positive space
<|endoftext|>

The one thing about
 a good man that i haven't
had to worry about
<|endoftext|>

The only thing I
 wanted in this movie was
a cat fighting for fame
<|endoftext|>

I'm so happy I
 haven't seen anything like
this in a week or two
<|endoftext|>

When you are happy
 you are very happy with
youself and others
<|endoftext|>

i'm just a bit bored
 i might add that i'm a bit
stressed but i'm fine yay
<|endoftext|>

This guy really is
 so cute and so smart with his
briefcase I love him
<|endoftext|>

Goddamn it's been a
 week since I've seen The Lego
movie it's amazing
<|endoftext|>

Wish I could be a
 part of that situation
in your life too lol
<|endoftext|>

If you ever get
 in my way just leave me be
because I will not
<|endoftext|>

Why are people so
 quick to judge people for the
way some people live
<|endoftext|>

I really don't understand
 what the problem is it's
just a mistake now
<|endoftext|>

My parents are the
 best and I deserve the best
in my life right now
<|endoftext|>

I'm so hungry I
 have no idea what to
eat or wear so that
<|endoftext|>

I'm a nice person
 I don't lie I just don't
think like they say
<|endoftext|>

I wish someone could
 help me get to the ground like
soon as possible
<|endoftext|>

You can't be nice to
 someone who's a bitch It'll get
you nowhere for sure
<|endoftext|>

That's it I've got a
 new job so that's the end lol
I'm just a baby now
<|endoftext|>

So ready to be
 out on the town now I'll need
a new boyfriend lol
<|endoftext|>

Gotta do what I
 gotta do Got to do what I
got to do to get things
<|endoftext|>

i love my momma
 her baby and i love him
a whole lil more lol
<|endoftext|>

There is no reason
 to fear the dark for there is
a reason too good
<|endoftext|>

you never know
 that a girl is getting with
another woman
<|endoftext|>

My friend just brought home
 a box of chips and he has
me feeling like I'm
<|endoftext|>

I never got to
 see the end of The Lion King
I'm really in shock
<|endoftext|>

Just when I've been getting
 my shit together all week
now I'm stuck with it
<|endoftext|>

No offense but I'd
 rather live with a good book
than an unwell man
<|endoftext|>

Can't believe it's April
 It's only been a week and
I already feel
<|endoftext|>

I'm starting to get
 excited again for
my friend's wedding next month
<|endoftext|>

This reminds me of
 a time I had to ask my
fiancé to come with
<|endoftext|>

I don't understand
 why my stomach is starting
to hurt so much now
<|endoftext|>

The greatest thing in
 life is being able to
understand people
<|endoftext|>

So excited for
 Sunday's so far I don't get
time to go to the
<|endoftext|>

I get upset when
 people text me and leave like
f you now you're irrelevant
<|endoftext|>

Someone make a
 video so I can
be on in the club

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 out by them
<|endoftext|>

My mom's a complete
 sissy if she put on these
clothes at the mall lol
<|endoftext|>

my sister and i
 do the same dumb shit now even
after she asked me
<|endoftext|>

This is what happens
 when you live for something and
nothing else stays the
<|endoftext|>

I always think it
 would be better to not make
a point to speak on
<|endoftext|>

I don't even like
 to cook I just don't want to
be a kitchen freak
<|endoftext|>

Can't remember the
 last time I didn't sleep I
just want to be home
<|endoftext|>

I could never keep
 up with a person for too
long no wonder I
<|endoftext|>

I'm going through some
 stuff today it's the truth the
truth we both know it
<|endoftext|>

If you have faith and
 don't doubt that your doing it
because you want it
<|endoftext|>

You're talking about
 a lot of things this week and
I'm pretty fed up
<|endoftext|>

I'm not scared of the
 future but I'd rather make
it a mistake anyway
<|endoftext|>

i'm ready to find
 these new places and meet all these
people soon so thank
<|endoftext|>

What happens to all
 the good players who left the
club to go home yay
<|endoftext|>

It's really gonna
 be a bitch to watch in the
coming days I'm worried
<|endoftext|>

I'm watching the new
 episode right now It makes me
feel so so alive
<|endoftext|>

How you gonna say
 that my baby girl was the
biggest bitch to ever
<|endoftext|>

I was about to
 do shit to myself to make
you forget about
<|endoftext|>

I just realized
 people in my world are from
my world at least that's
<|endoftext|>

Welp no one got their
 ass when ur trying to sleep
I got it cuddled
<|endoftext|>

My son is starting
 to learn to be more independent
and less of a dog
<|endoftext|>

I never get to
 call a date until I make
it to the mall lol
<|endoftext|>

I don't wanna let
 her go I just wanna know
who did me this wrong
<|endoftext|>

There's just someone right
 there right next to me if you
could just say hi too
<|endoftext|>

I'm about to get
 out the shower to play with
the kids my stomach hurt
<|endoftext|>

Alfie was the funniest
 dude to ever grace twitter
that really says it
<|endoftext|>

Wish they would get more
 positive people behind their
movements rather
<|endoftext|>

Don't ever leave my
 side like this I swear that I'd
fall in love with you
<|endoftext|>

When I feel like death
 by a thousand cuts I'll ask
the angels for help
<|endoftext|>

I'm in a bad mood
 cause the other day my mama
sang the blues when I slept
<|endoftext|>

if there's a better
 way to have your cake and eat
it then please please let me
<|endoftext|>

I'm just going to
 go out and get drunk on my
own for once in a
<|endoftext|>

I've been a big
 believer on this album
since we played it out
<|endoftext|>

I'm a horrible
 person so I can't be on
any of you beats
<|endoftext|>

Ain't no shame in
 hating yourself for not
being able to
<|endoftext|>

People are so mean
 that I find people I want
to be friends with so
<|endoftext|>

People ask me how
 I'm doing on twitter
and i can't answer
<|endoftext|>

LOL I DON'T EVEN
 EVEN LIKE TO MUR

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 fingers and the thought of
being alone always
<|endoftext|>

I don't even own
 a computer at this point
I just have my cell
<|endoftext|>

People really have
 nothing to say they just think
that's what everyone else
<|endoftext|>

I've never been so
 happy and comfortable
in my life EVER
<|endoftext|>

My mom is the best
 aunt I ever met she can
do anything
<|endoftext|>

I'm sure someone somewhere
 has some good news just a fact
I just can't find it
<|endoftext|>

I haven't cried in
 a while and I never thought
that I'd feel like this
<|endoftext|>

I'm so hungry im
 tired I don't wanna go
home to my mom lol
<|endoftext|>

Why does anyone
 want to know why the fuck
I was feeling this
<|endoftext|>

It is a fact that
 any action taken by
Trump causes chaos
<|endoftext|>

The problem with the
 NFL is not the teams
getting cheated on
<|endoftext|>

I have never cried
 in my whole life and this is
what it really feels
<|endoftext|>

I can't wait to go
 to The Black Rock this weekend
but to sleep in the
<|endoftext|>

i haven't even
 been able to sleep so the
night owls might not know
<|endoftext|>

Why are I constantly
 feeling like it's the other
way around I have
<|endoftext|>

It's so important
 to give back to people who
are doing you wrong
<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you gotta
 just put them to rest and move
them off my mind lol
<|endoftext|>

I've seen you on this
 feed I've never seen you like
this so I'm just that
<|endoftext|>

Wanna show what I've
 got till I got some shit I
have over there tho
<|endoftext|>

If you're happy don't
 complain cause nobody else
is happy for you
<|endoftext|>

It's so nice to
 talk to people you don't know
and care for about
<|endoftext|>

I never thought I'd
 see the day that I'd be able
to write something great
<|endoftext|>

If the world had a
 way to turn off the lights that
would be awesome
<|endoftext|>

When you really love
 somebody don't talk to them
about how u feel
<|endoftext|>

I have been going
 through a lot lately but it's
making up for it
<|endoftext|>

That's the problem with
 these girls don't be fake when
you're down It's all fake
<|endoftext|>

imagine being
 not in a relationship
but still having kids
<|endoftext|>

The most annoying
 part about the game is how
no one ever talks
<|endoftext|>

That's it the boys turn
 themselves into this girl from
Wicked and all that
<|endoftext|>

I can't believe you
 still haven't forgiven me
It's too late baby
<|endoftext|>

i'm just gonna lay
 on my couch and drink myself
over the next few
<|endoftext|>

It's funny cause if
 he had gone to the bathroom
it would have been over
<|endoftext|>

I'm tired from the
 grind tomorrow so I may
as well go to sleep
<|endoftext|>

I really can't wait
 for my daughter to get out of
home by the end of the
week I'm happy u
<|endoftext|>

This weather makes me
 want to curl and just fall back
into my bed lol
<|endoftext|>

I'd really rather
 have my hair messed with tomorrow
than get it done
<|endoftext|>

If you ain't got no
 issues with me I can't be
with ya at all now
<|endoftext|>

I just wanna say
 thanks for the watch thank you for
your support of me
<|endof
